            <highlights>NEW: Police say a purse containing Upham's ID was found with the body Actress was last seen October 5 and reported missing the next day Upham appeared in "August: Osage County" and "Frozen River"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- The body of "August: Osage County" actress Misty Upham is believed to have been found along a river in suburban Seattle, police said Thursday. The body was found by a member of Upham's family during a search for the actress, according to police in Auburn, Washington. It was found at the bottom of a steep embankment near the White River. The body has not been officially identified, but a purse containing Upham's ID was found with the remains, police said. Upham, 32, was last seen October 5 walking from her sister's apartment in Muckleshoot, Washington, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. She was reported missing the following day. Actress' disappearance baffles family Her father said she has bipolar disorder and bouts of depression and anxiety, but didn't think she was suicidal. "The truth is Misty is not stressed over money or career. Her career is going great," he wrote Sunday. "As her father I do not fear she committed suicide. I feel that she has been hurt by accident or someone has put her in harms way." Upham had small roles in "Django Unchained" and "August: Osage County," and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in 2008's "Frozen River." She's also had roles in the TV series "Big Love" and the TV movie "Skinwalkers." She was currently shooting a film called "Crawlspace," according to the Internet Movie Database. CNN's Cheri Mossburg and Lorenza Brascia also contributed to this story. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>10-year-old shooter: 'I want to be an inspiration' - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>Meet Shyanne Roberts, a 10-year-old competitive shooter Her father feels comfortable with her using firearms Parents are very involved in the sport with their children Shyanne practices 15 hours a week minimum</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- She picks up the custom handgun painted in her favorite colors, purple and black. Her long, black braid bounces slightly with each of the six shots she fires. Metal pings signify when she's hit the mark. She runs to the next target. Nine more shots. Reload. Meet Shyanne Roberts, a 10-year-old competitive shooter who is out to prove something: Children with guns don't always mean disaster. "I want to be an inspiration to other kids and be a leader," said the girl. "Kids and guns don't always mean bad things happen." Natural talent turns into a passion Shyanne competes alongside junior shooters, who are participants younger than 18, and even adults. Last year, she beat out adult women to place second in the Women's Division of the New Jersey Ruger Rimfire Challenge. On October 31, she will square off against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownell's Lady 3-Gun Pro-Am Challenge in Covington, Georgia. Shyanne is the youngest competitive shooter registered at the female-only event, according to the match director. The top shooter has a chance to win $5,000, as well as items from a prize table of guns, ammo and more. The Franklinville, New Jersey, girl, who now has more than 20 sponsors, started learning gun safety when she was 5. After she could recite the rules and had grasped what guns can do, around age 6, her father started taking her to a gun range. Dan Roberts is a certified firearms instructor and a single dad. He has custody of Shyanne and her younger brother. Shyanne's natural talent turned into a passion and at 7, the young athlete started competing in local matches. Physically, a competitive shooter needs to have good hand and forearm strength, as well as the ability to handle the firearm's sometimes-strong recoil. Good technique also helps. Not every child is ready to wield a gun When asked how he feels about his daughter using a gun, her father said, "I feel very comfortable because I know she's been extraordinarily well-trained at how to be safe. I could have a fully loaded machine gun, and she would not dream of touching it because the curiosity factor has been eliminated." Roberts believes early firearm education and training are the keys to reducing gun accidents. He argues that if kids knew about guns at a young age, their curiosity wouldn't get the best of them, leaving tragedy in their trail. Even under direct supervision, giving kids access to guns can be deadly. A 9-year-old girl accidentally shot and killed her instructor with a submachine gun called an Uzi in August, causing anti-gun activists to reiterate their objections to allowing guns anywhere around children. Roberts balks at the notion that training children to use guns poses an increased danger. "We can teach fourth-graders safe-sex practices, but we can't mention teaching firearm education in a public grade school without anti-gun groups having a complete meltdown. ... It's completely ludicrous," he said. Not everyone is convinced that teaching gun safety at a young age is the key to preventing accidents. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign and Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, says it's not enough. "It's not to say that teaching your kids gun safety can't help, but relying on that alone is an extremely dangerous mentality," Gross said. "I see tragedies every day that wind up occurring because a parent thought that their child knew better." Roberts trusts his daughter, but that doesn't mean he believes that every child, or even adult, is ready to wield a gun. "As an instructor for over a decade, I've been around adults that shouldn't be within 10 feet of a slingshot," he said. "I have a 10-year-old daughter that's a competitive athlete. It really depends on the kids involved." 'It's not just a hobby' The fifth-grader's determination to win a national title before she's an adult shows in how she talks about her career -- "It's not a hobby; it's what I want to do!" she insists. There aren't many children beating adults at matches, at least not since KC Eusebio. The California native started shooting competitively at 8. By the time he was 10, he became the youngest Master shooter in the history of the United States Practical Shooting Association. Eusebio, who is in his mid-20s, is a professional shooter for Glock's competitive shooting team. Winning a competition typically means recognition, free equipment and sponsorships, according to USPSA Media Director Chris Taylor. Rarely do the wins yield cash prizes. "You're really not going to make any money doing this. This is an expensive sport," he said. "The ones who are professional shooters aren't making a living on money; they're making a living on sponsorships." 3-Gun Nation, a different shooting style within competitive shooting, is an exception to the cash rule. At each match, the winner gets a pot of money. And at the championship, the top shooter wins $50,000. Shyanne may not be a professional, but she is a rare breed. "At 10 years old, it's tough to be doing anything well, as your muscles aren't quite developed yet. That's pretty impressive," said Taylor, when he heard someone that young was beating adults in competition. "It's 95% males that get involved (in USPSA), but the funny thing is that girls tend to do better than the boys, in general," he said. "I think it's that they're more open to coaching." Shyanne participates in several types of shooting styles, including USPSA, 3-Gun, Action Rifle and Steel Silhouette. USPSA and 3-Gun are two of about seven major styles within the sport of competitive shooting. Participants use shotguns, rifles or pistols, or a combination of different firearms, depending on the shooting style, Taylor said. When looking at target shooting across all the styles, there's been a 67% increase in the number of women participating in the past decade. More than 6.4 million women competed in 2012, compared with 3.8 million women in 2003, according to the National Sporting Goods Association's annual sports participation reports. USPSA membership is smaller, with about 25,000 active members and 500 children in the junior division, Taylor said. "We're probably one of the smaller niche sports out there." The male version of 'Dance Moms'? Because of the small group size, USPSA participants are part of a close-knit community, Taylor said. "Even though it's really competitive, it's one of the most congenial, social groups I've ever been a part of." Dan and Shyanne are very much a part of that culture. Roberts said he was recently trading text messages with a woman from Wisconsin whose daughter also competes. They plan to set up their camps next to each other at the next match. Parents tend to be very involved in their child's participation, much like any other sport. Competitive shooting costs money. Roberts buys firearms intended for Shyanne -- she can't legally own her two rifles and two shotguns until she's 18 and her three pistols until she's 21. There are also jerseys and gear that he gets customized for his daughter. Beyond the money, there's a big time commitment. Shyanne lives 15 minutes from the shooting range, and she tries to practice at least 30 minutes on each firearm -- shotgun, pistol and rifle -- every day. Sometimes that's not realistic, as homework comes first, Roberts said. All together, Shyanne practices about 15 hours per week. Her dad says that's on the low end of what it should be. "The next level she needs to get to is where she can walk out the back door onto her own private training range and shoot every day," Roberts said. At first impression, this can seem like a male version of "dance moms": overbearing mothers thrusting their dance dreams on their children, pushing them to practice and win prizes. Taylor, who attends USPSA events all over the country, says it's not quite like that in competitive shooting. Participants are trying to beat their own scores. "It's your performance that determines your outcome," he said. "It's not quite the same thing as dance moms. You don't have that kind of drama." An inkling of the competitive side of the sport came out while interviewing Shyanne over the phone. Her father could be heard nearby. "I do have others hobbies like playing soccer and like ..." Shyanne said. "Hanging out," her dad whispered in the background. "Hanging out with my friends and ..." she said. "But this is what I really want to do," he whispered. "But this is really what I really want to do." Roberts admits that it was his idea to see whether Shyanne wanted to compete in matches. "I never in my wildest dreams thought this is where we would be at just a few years after teaching her basic gun safety and education," he said. "As an instructor, I noticed she had a natural talent. I brought up the idea to see if she wanted to do a match and she said yes." When she got second place at a competition early on in her career, Roberts said that's when he saw it click. His daughter was hooked on the sport. Roberts said as long as Shyanne is having fun, he'll keep being her advocate, coach, PR guy and more. When it stops being fun, that'll be the end of it. "I want her to have as much success as she possibly can," he said. "If all that ever comes out of this is that she gets a scholarship to a college with a rifle team," -- there are 31 colleges that sponsor NCAA rifle teams -- "and if as a father I have the peace of mind that she can defend herself, I'm thrilled with just that." "The rest is just extra." But if you ask Shyanne what her dream is, the answer is much simpler: "I want to win the national title."  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NASA snaps photo of sun looking a lot like a Halloween jack-o-lantern October 8 image "blends together two sets of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- It wasn't a trick. But for space geeks, it sure was a treat. An image, taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory on October 8, captured the sun getting into the Halloween spirit. "Active regions on the sun combined to look something like a solar jack-o'-lantern's face," said Joe Witte of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. There's no cause for alarm -- it's just the center of our solar system's spooky Halloween costume. Big solar storm hits earth "The active regions in this image appear brighter because those are areas that emit more light and energy," explained Witte. "This image blends together two sets of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths." And that's what gives the sun that freaky feel. Blood moon has millions gazing at the skies  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>Biden's son discharged from Navy after drug test - CNN.com</title>

            <text>Washington (CNN) -- The Navy Reserve discharged Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter this year after he tested positive for cocaine, U.S. officials confirmed. The discharge of Biden, a 44-year-old lawyer and managing partner at an investment firm, was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. He confirmed the report in a statement to CNN. "It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge. I respect the Navy's decision. With the love and support of my family, I'm moving forward," he said. Biden was commissioned as an ensign in May 2013 and assigned as a public affairs officer in a Norfolk, Virginia-based reserve unit. A month later, he tested positive for cocaine, and he was discharged in February, according to the report. The U.S. official said the Navy never had contact with the vice president's office over the issue, and that standard procedure for failed drug tests is administrative discharge. The vice president's office didn't comment on the report. Hunter Biden is the younger of Biden's two sons. His older brother, Beau Biden, is Delaware's attorney general and a major in the Delaware Army National Guard. He was deployed for a year in Iraq. CNN's Barbara Starr and Jim Acosta contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>A freight train and passenger train collide in northwest Arkansas Police say six crew members and 38 passengers were injured The National Transportation Safety Board is en route to crash site</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- A scenic fall tour turned into a nightmare ride for passengers in northwest Arkansas on Thursday after a freight train and a passenger train collision left dozens injured. The six crew members and 38 passengers aboard were all injured, according to the Arkansas Missouri Railroad Police. The passenger train is operated by the Arkansas and Missouri Railroad, said Ron Sparks, the railroad's police chief. The train departed from Springdale, Arkansas, and was headed to Van Buren to take passengers on a fall foliage excursion. The trains collided Thursday morning when the passenger train stalled on a small grade, apparently because of excess leaves on the track, according to police. "We called for another locomotive to come help," said Sparks. "Somehow there was miscommunication on the passenger train's position, and the locomotive rounded the curve and crashed into the passenger train," added Sparks. "It's a pretty rural area, we had to park in woods, and wade through a river to get the passengers, using four-wheelers to pull them out." One of the train's conductors fractured his ankle and back and was evacuated to the hospital, said Sparks. Local fire and police emergency responders remain on the scene, according to local police. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to the site of the crash Thursday evening to investigate. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Two male students dressed as Miss America and Nicki Minaj for Spirit Week Principal told them to go change or go home Superintendent says the situation should have been handled differently</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- When administrators at White Pass Jr. Sr. High School in Randle, Washington, asked students to dress up as their favorite celebrities for Spirit Week, Mason Mudge and Chandler Krueger did just that. Mudge came as Miss America. And Krueger dressed up as Nicki Minaj. But Principal Gary Stamper reportedly wasn't feeling their school spirit. According to CNN affiliate KING5 News, Stamper told the boys to change -- or go home. "If they really wanted Spirit Week, then why punish somebody for being spirited and all that?" Krueger asks. The 10th-graders refused to switch clothing and left school. The next day, many of their classmates skipped American Pride Day and instead came to school dressed as the opposite sex in protest of what had happened. Superintendent Chuck Wyborney told KING5 News that things should have been handled differently with Krueger and Mudge. None of the students on the second day were asked to change. "I think it's really awesome that all the kids support me and support the decisions that I made," Mudge said. More schools around the country are adopting acceptance policies in support of transgender children and children who don't conform to gender norms. Wyborney told KING5 News that this was a learning opportunity for both students and staff.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Tom Frieden of the CDC and Lisa Monaco of Homeland Security have led effort so far President Barack Obama says flu season and ISIS will also demand their attention "It may make sense for us to have one person" coordinating effort, Obama says Obama has no "philosophical objection" to West Africa travel ban, but isn't leaning that way</highlights>
            <text>Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday night that it "may be appropriate" for him to appoint a czar to lead his administration's response to Ebola. "It may make sense for us to have one person ... so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward," Obama said. His comments to reporters in the Oval Office came after a meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco and others. Obama pointed to those two as the leaders of the U.S. response to Ebola so far. He said they've done an "outstanding job" so far, but that with flu season coming and Homeland Security officials also involved in combatting ISIS, "they also are responsible for a whole bunch of other stuff." Obama also said he has no "philosophical objection" to a ban on travel between West Africa and the United States. But said that doing so could make it tougher to determine whether passengers entering the United States from elsewhere had recently visited the region that's at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. He said a "flat-out travel ban is not the way to go" and that it's less effective than other steps the United States has already taken. Some lawmakers have clamored in recent days for a travel ban, arguing that the United States should be able to track international passengers from the origins of their flights. "You ought to look at at least immediately suspending visas for non-U.S. nationals," GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana told Obama administration officials at a House committee hearing Thursday.

            <highlights>Joan Rivers' death "resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy," report says It was "during laryngoscopy and ... endoscopy with propofol sedation" The initial report did not name the doctor or doctors Rivers, 81, died a week after an appointment at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers died of "therapeutic complications" during a procedure to evaluate her "voice changes" and stomach reflux, the New York medical examiner said Thursday. "The classification of a death as a therapeutic complication means that the death resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy," the report said. Rivers, 81, died September 4, a week after an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. The medical examiner's investigation ruled that the cause of death was "anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest," a medical description of brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen. The arrest happened "during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease," the medical examiner's officer said. The complication in this case was laryngospasm -- a spasm of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe, pathologist and surgeon Bill Lloyd told CNN. The situation was compounded when Rivers went into cardiac arrest. "She stopped breathing and her heart went into arrhythmia because there wasn't sufficient oxygen to maintain the heart muscle," said Lloyd, who was not involved in Rivers' autopsy. "The pump, the heart itself, was unable to move fresh oxygenated blood upstream to the brain." At first, Lloyd said, Rivers was unable to bring oxygen into her body due to the vocal cord spasm. After a couple of minutes, her heart started to beat irregularly or completely stopped. Finally, her heart stopped delivering fresh oxygenated blood to her brain, which shut down, according to Lloyd. "The unanswered question is why they did not do a combat (tracheotomy)?" he asked. "You've seen in the James Bond movies. You take a ballpoint pen and puncture the thyroid cartilage and create an emergency airway for her. Of course, they would do it with sterile instruments. ... And, after minute two, did anybody say, We need to start doing some CPR for her?" The initial report did not name the doctor or doctors who performed the procedures. Melissa Rivers posted this on Twitter on Friday afternoon: "In response to NYC's Medical examiner's report, we continue to be saddened by our tragic loss. No further comment at this time." Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death What happened? Several clinic workers told investigators that the August 28 appointment began with Rivers' personal throat doctor, Dr. Gwen Korovin, performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds, a source close to the investigation told CNN last month. Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning after Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. Cohen detected something of concern, the source said. Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source. Korovin was authorized only to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said. Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated. But Korovin denied "performing an unauthorized procedure" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN last month. Paramedics rushed Rivers from the clinic to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. E!'s 'Fashion Police' to continue without Joan Rivers Doctor to the stars Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autographed photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews. "I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music," Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year. Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN last month in response to reports that questioned whether her actions played any role in Rivers' death. "Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. "As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient."

            <text>(CNN) -- Actress Elizabeth Peña has died of natural causes after a brief illness, her manager told CNN. She was 55. Peña passed away Tuesday, Gina Rugolo said in a statement. Among her many roles, Peña is known for appearing as the mother of a character played by Sofia Vergara in the ABC sitcom "Modern Family." She's played on both the big and small screens during her more than three-decade career. She also tried her hand at directing, becoming only the fourth Latina member of the Director's Guild of America when she joined, the statement said. Other career highlights include roles in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "La Bamba," "Rush Hour," and "The Incredibles." Most recently, Peña appeared in the TV drama "Matador." "I am stunned and heartbroken, just found out about the passing of my friend Elizabeth Peña. She was such a Life Force it's hard to believe," tweeted actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred in "La Bamba." "Elizabeth was not only an amazing actress, she was one of the most vibrant, wonderful people I have ever known. My prayers to her family," he said. Peña was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and she graduated from New York's High School of Performing Arts in 1977. She is survived by her mother, a sister, her husband, and two children.

            <title>Drone shows life and death of killer whales - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T17:39:50Z</date>

            <highlights>Scientists flew UAV 100 feet above whales to determine their weight Two skinny whales died during short scientific mission Pictures also found pregnant female Scientists photographed 82 whales during 13-day expedition</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Killer whale families swimming, playing and, in the sad case of two orcas, dying. That's what researchers from the federal government's NOAA Fisheries and the Vancouver Aquarium were able document using an unmanned aerial vehicle (sometimes called a drone) flying over the Johnstone Strait off British Columbia earlier this year. The researchers said it was the first time a UAV, in this case a custom-built hexacopter dubbed Mobly that carried high resolution cameras, to record the behaviors and health of killer whales. The mission followed British Columbia northern resident killer whales which are considered threatened under the Canadian government's Species at Risk Act, according to a NOAA Fisheries release. The UAV flew at 100 feet above the whales so as not to disturb them and got pictures of 82 whales during the 13-day mission in August. The researchers were trying to determine the health of the orcas by seeing if they were getting enough food, a task they accomplished by noting whether the creatures were skinny or fat. In a video, NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center biologist John Durban points out the contrast between the skinny whale, known as A-37, on the left and the healthy A-47 on the right. "If you look, you can see the skull of that whale (A-37) quite effectively in the picture, so you can see the snout and you can see this ridge along the top of the snout, so really you can visualize where the skull of that whale is. It really doesn't have any fat behind the skull that we're used to seeing," Durban said. "It's a skeleton with skin over it." He then points out how A-37s pectoral fins are widely extended to provide extra lift as the whale is lacking the fat to give it normal buoyancy. And then the tragedy. "We flew over him a couple of times and got these incredible images, and then while we were up there, he disappeared and he stopped swimming with his brother and has almost certainly passed away," he said. WWF: World has lost more than half its wildlife in 40 years Lance Barrett-Lennard, who head the Vancouver Aquarium's Marine Mammal Research Program, wrote in a blog post on why the UAV made a big difference in showing the weight of the whales. "It turns out when killer whales lose weight they replace much of the fat in their blubber layer with water in order to maintain a firm, streamlined shape. They don't look thin from a side view until they are drastically malnourished and a large indent develops behind the blowhole, Barret-Lennard wrote. He wrote that the researchers noted weight loss in one other orca, I-63, a female that had lost a calf earlier in the year. "Her subsequent death made us wonder if she had been sick or injured," Barret-Lennard wrote. 'Where's Waldo' ... but for science Durban said the whales themselves take note of the loss of one of their pod. Other whale researchers monitoring acoustics in the area of the aerial study noted increased calling from A-46, A-37's brother, shortly before and after A-37 disappeared. "It's interesting whether those calls were related to his brother, whether he was looking for him or whether he was telling others he was gone. We don't know," Durban said. "You know, they do family better than we do. They have to notice the absence of an animal that's swum with them their whole life, and I think more than notice it, I think it can have a big effect on them." But there was plenty to be happy about. The aerial views also enable the researchers to determine which whales were pregnant. Pointing out one picture, Durban says, "You can clearly see that she has her maximum girth just behind the dorsal fin, just like us, you know, when we get pregnant. The belly of the mother starts to get big below the ribcage. That's what we see here."  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NCAA grants dying teen's wish University moves season opener so she can play "I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis," Lauren Hill says</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- A terminally ill basketball player in Ohio will get a chance to make her dreams come true with her first college game. Lauren Hill, 19, an incoming freshman at Mount Saint Joseph University, was diagnosed with a brain tumor last year. Her diagnosis came during her final year of high school. A few weeks before she found out, she'd signed up to play basketball at Mount Saint Joseph. Undeterred, she played ball in high school despite rounds of chemotherapy for her inoperable tumor, CNN affiliate WKRC reported. "I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore," she told the affiliate. Last month, doctors told her she doesn't have much time left to live. The university asked the NCAA if it can move its season opener by two weeks to November 2, according to the affiliate. The answer was yes. Hill will join her new teammates for her first college game against Hiram College. She plans to wear her No. 22 jersey. Her first college game may be her last one. Doctors have told her she only has until December to live, the affiliate reported.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>Ebola fears crippling Africa's safari industry - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>Safari operators report cancellations, huge drop in bookings due to Ebloa fears Geographical misconceptions are leading many travelers to avoid Africa completely Tour operator: "Many people still look at Africa as a homogeneous country and not as the second largest continent"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- With travel to Africa poised to hit all-time highs in 2014, a drop-off in travel bookings was the last thing the continent's lucrative safari industry thought it would be facing going into 2015. But despite the fact that the main safari destinations in southern and eastern Africa are thousands of kilometers from the Ebola-stricken countries of the west, industry leaders say fears of the disease are keeping tourists away. A survey based on feedback from more than 500 safari operators conducted by African booking company Safaribookings.com found that as of late September, more than half reported a 20 to 70% decline in bookings. "Numerous safari tour operators report to us that clients view Africa as a single country when it comes to risk assessment," Wouter Vergeer, Safaribookings.com founder, tells CNN. Vergeer says the impact is most noticeable in East Africa, home to safari hotspots such as Kenya's Masai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti -- places located nearly 5,000 kilometers from the West Africa Ebola outbreak area. "Most people don't realize how vast Africa is and that East and southern Africa are just as far from the outbreak area as Europe or South America," says Vergeer. "All safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no Ebola cases the risk of infection is effectively zero." Convincing clients they'll be safe Jake McCormick, a safari specialist with Shadows of Africa, says the Ebola outbreak has caused a 70% decrease in inquiries at his company, which offers tours in Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Zanzibar. "We are still working to try to convince clients they are safe from this disease, but until we see the outbreak come under control my feeling is that it will be a while until things return to normal," he says. Joao Oliveira, founder of It Started in Africa, which organizes safaris and Kilimanjaro treks in Tanzania and Kenya, tells a similar story. "We did not have any cancellations but we had much fewer bookings," he says. "The reason I believe there have been no cancellations is because the clients who have already paid -- safaris are usually booked several months in advance and a down payment is required -- do their own research and find out that the Ebola countries are more than 5,000 kilometers away from Tanzania or Kenya. "As for the reduction in bookings, I believe it is because those who are planning their vacations are now not even considering going to Africa because of Ebola." Oliveira says 2014 was on track to be his company's most profitable year to date. Then, as news of the Ebloa crisis spread, panic set in. "In July, we projected that August would be our best month ever and then the panic started and August was the worst month of the last two years. September was the same." He says October looks like it's improving slightly but it's difficult to tell at this point. "It does not make sense," he adds. "You would not cancel your vacation in Paris because there are conflicts in the Middle East or in Ukraine. If something nasty was happening in Alaska, you'd still go to New York." MORE: 'Fear-bola' hits epidemic proportions 'Africa is seen as a country' Brett Thomson, managing director of Sun Safaris, says that in addition to traveler queries being down 50 to 70%, new bookings compared with last October are also down about 50%. "Over the past month we have had numerous clients replying that they will be in touch after all the health scares are over," says Thomson. "Even if we explain how far southern Africa is from West Africa, it does not change their mind. Africa is seen as a country and hardly ever as a continent." Daniel Njamwea, managing director of safari travel booking company Lilac Adventures, agrees that it's been difficult trying to convince clients how far East Africa is from West Africa -- especially Kenya. "This morning I was dealing with clients over Skype who are coming on October 25 and are worried since they read in the news that there is a woman who died at Jomo Kenyatta airport last weekend and feared that she had Ebola," says Njamwea. "It was hard to convince them that she tested negative for Ebola. I had to refer them to Ministry of Health website to read more details." The other big problem, say those in the industry, is a lack of knowledge of how Ebola is contracted. "Although the Ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and is currently limited to destinations in West Africa, we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent," says Charlie Bateson, product director of high end travel company Abercrombie &amp; Kent. "We remain in constant contact with the FCO, WHO and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world. "Our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears." Meanwhile, Rose Hipwood of the Luxury Safari Company says the top end of Africa's safari market hasn't been hit as hard by Ebola fears "since many of those clients are international travelers and can look at the situation sensibly." "Some clients have indeed decided not to book safaris this year after inquiring -- but sadly in this industry we get a lot of time wasters and I believe those people would have found another reason not to book if not Ebola, although families are always more protective of their little ones," says Hipwood. Africa tourism was poised for growth Though no figures have been released on the overall impact Ebola has had on African tourism, in the first half of 2014 the industry had been experiencing impressive growth rates. According to the World Tourism Organization's 2014 global travel report, Africa was due to see 4 to 6% tourism growth this year. In 2013, the continent saw international arrivals increase 5% over 2012, the equivalent of 3 million more tourists, to reach 56 million. "This year is (now) written off already," says Njamwea, of Lilac Adventures. "By this time hotels should be issuing stop sales for the Christmas period, but I have seen none, meaning they still have availability. "Though this could have been due to other factors like cancellations of direct charter flights from Europe due to security risks, Ebola has too played a great part." London-based James Strawson tells CNN he'd been considering a trip to Gambia in late November until the Ebola crisis erupted. "I wanted to go away for some winter sunshine," he says. "I've been to Gambia previously and it's a good time zone, easy to get to and quite nice and warm." Strawson, 26, said media "hysteria" related to Ebola changed his mind. "I just looked at the headlines and thought, it looks bad now, who knows what it will look like in a few weeks?" Strawson, who works in finance, says he's not completely ruled out an Africa trip and is now planning a vacation in Zanzibar. 'World-class epidemiological detective work' Since the outbreak started in March, about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. And the numbers are expected to skyrocket. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the WHO said. It warned that things will get worse before they get better. In August, WHO issued a warning saying Kenya had a high risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak, but as yet the country hasn't seen a single case. The WHO says it's due to declare the end of the Ebola outbreak in Senegal and Nigeria on Friday and Monday, respectively. "In a piece of world-class epidemiological detective work, all confirmed cases in Nigeria were eventually linked back to the Liberian air traveler who introduced the virus into the country on July 20," said WHO in a statement. MORE: Liberia has shortage of body bags, supplies to fight Ebola outbreak Precautionary measures in eastern and southern African countries fighting to keep Ebola from entering their borders vary, with some countries banning travelers who have visited affected countries, while others have adopted strict border screening measures. Botswana, for instance, has reportedly suspended entry for travelers who have visited Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone in the last 30 days. In Tanzania, all major border posts have mandatory health screening in place, including all international airports. South Africa refuses to admit foreign citizens arriving from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa, while South African citizens will be allowed to re-enter, but only after being subject to strict screening. The Africa Travel Association (ATA), a global trade association that promotes travel and tourism to Africa, released a statement to CNN. "According to the WHO, the most severely affected countries are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, however, the Africa tourism industry has felt stark repercussions across the continent through economic losses, canceled flights and bookings, closed borders and negative perceptions," it said. "These impacts reach far beyond the borders of those affected countries. ATA urges the travel industry and traveling public to remain cautious, however, to acknowledge the immense size of the continent and to continue to travel to the vast majority of the countries that remain safe."

            <text>Every week, Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa, exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures, countries and regions. (CNN) -- It all started with David Kato, the Ugandan gay-rights activist who was bludgeoned to death in his home in 2011. That's what first drew award-winning photojournalist Daniella Zalcman to Kampala to meet the country's few but fearless gay-rights activists. A year earlier, Ugandan tabloid Rolling Stone (no connection to the music magazine) published names, addresses and photographs of 100 alleged homosexuals under the banner "Hang Them" (Kato was among those named). "I reached out to the activism community, which was smaller than it is now -- and it's not exactly large," recalls Zalcman, whose ongoing reporting in Uganda has been supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. On that first trip, she took a series of portraits of Uganda's LGBT activists called "Double Lives," part of a larger series called "Kuchus in Uganda." "I was surprised that they agreed to meet me. I can't understand the amount of bravery required for them to do that." The next chapter In 2013, the Anti-Homosexuality Act passed through parliament, but Uganda's gays and lesbians continued to feel the pressure. The new law increased the penalty for homosexuals from a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to a life sentence, and introduced a fine and three-year prison term for anyone who, knowing of the existence of a homosexual, failed to turn him or her over to the authorities. The law was struck down in August on a technicality, but being gay still comes with a jail sentence. While in Kampala, Zalcman decided she wanted to hear the views of everyday Ugandans, as well as their spiritual leaders. "Everyone in Uganda goes to church, mosque, temple, whatever. And religious leaders aren't just giving sermons. They are really a support network. They are advisers and leaders in their communities and what they say really matters, so I wanted to know the breadth of opinion that was coming from the pulpit every Sunday." Motorbike mission Zalcman interviewed imams, rabbis, pastors -- leaders in every denomination represented in the country -- to ask them what their views on subject really were. "I went to American-style mega churches in central Kampala and a Pentecostal church in a tin shack in the middle of a slum," she recalls. "Whenever there's a news item on this issue, we quote a few evangelical leaders who say truly horrific things, wishing death and injury and a fiery hell on gay people. But they're not representative." Zalcman encountered an array of voices, some stringently anti-gay, others tolerant, and many expressing uncertainty due to a lack of information and limited contact with homosexuals. "I met one imam who had been educated in Egypt and worked in Saudi and essentially told me he wished sharia law could be enacted in Uganda. Then, I met another imam who said, 'today you say you hate gay people, tomorrow God will give you a gay son. What will you do then?'" A Western export? Zalcman notes that it is common for Uganda's anti-gay zealots to attribute homosexuality to Western influences. However, she adds, homophobia is a concept that also comes from the West. In particular, she points to the efforts of American evangelist Scott Lively, who presented many of the arguments and tenants that later formed the anti-gay bill to individual members of Uganda's parliament. "Sexual identity and gender identity weren't discussed topics in Uganda, because people were in no way aware that (they) were a thing," says Zalcman. "Lively spoke to parliament just months before the first bill was drafted, and had a very obvious effect on public opinion." Despite the anti-gay rhetoric often spouted by Uganda's leaders in the Western media, Zalcman says she thinks most Ugandans are more indifferent on the subject than is often portrayed. "Statistics say that 96% of Ugandans believe homosexuality is not an acceptable way of life, but most people have greater things to worry about, and don't think this should be such a big issue in parliament. There are water issues, and sanitation issues, and greater things that most people want their MPs to care about."  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Rwandan student was living in Portland, U.S. when he came up with the idea for House of Tayo An accessories brand that accentuates African color, textiles and fabric into Western pieces Despite no formal business training, Rugamba has struck a chord with the fashion fans</highlights>
            <text>Every week, African Start-Up follows entrepreneurs in various countries across the continent to see how they are working to make their business dreams become reality. Kigali, Rwanda (CNN) -- The dandy look has long been associated with the style of the quintessential gentleman. It's elegant and sophisticated with sharp lines and immaculately tailored suits. But certain gentlemen in various parts of Africa have now taken the look to the next level. These dapper dressers can often be seen strutting down the streets of Kinshasa or Brazzaville, as is the case with the Congo's "sapeurs." And now, thanks to up-and-coming "Afro-dandy" designer Matthew Rugamba, the look has also emerged in the Rwandan capital of Kigali -- but with a more local twist. Classy and elegant, Rugamba's label House of Tayo combines bold African patterns and textures with western accessories to produce wax-print bow ties, colorful pocket squares and infinite scarfs for "Afro-dandies" in Rwanda and beyond. We sat down with sartorially chic Rugamba to chat all things dandy: how to get the look; African influences; style icons and who he'd most like to see don his designs. CNN: Tell me what you mean when you describe the House of Tayo style as "Afro-dandyism?" Matthew Rugamba: It hits the nail on the head for my style and what I try to do with my pieces. The additional use of color, patterns, texture -- it's uniquely African. Then going to boarding schools -- you had to have your shirt tucked in, tie done. So many different influences have had an impact on me and helped me deliver my personal style which I have integrated into House of Tayo. CNN: And what's this different side of Africa that you want to show? MR: One of the reasons I started House of Tayo was because I was actually going to school in the United States, and I had so many questions about how life is in Rwanda. Many people had these negative assumptions. They had notions of how bad life was here, poverty, war. And it used to bug me a lot. CNN: So you got sick of telling your friends they were wrong all the time? MR: Not necessarily my friends because I talk to them all the time. Just different people. It could be as random as the coffee shop conversation while you're waiting in line, those were the bits and pieces that would get under my skin. At least with my friends i could say, "Guys, come on! Let me show you pictures. You could visit me."And it was just this other ... you sit in a classroom and there is a limit to the amount of times you can correct people or even just if you are meeting someone for the first time, you're not going to go into this tirade of why you believe that their perceptions were wrong. CNN: Fair enough. Well what about House of Tayo showcases the styles and influences from Rwanda, then? MR: I think it's not necessarily Rwanda alone because I also lived in a couple of African countries, but I feel like general use of color, variation and also the presentation. Also the fact that its made in Rwanda and I'm using bits and pieces that are sourced locally. One of the things that I started doing, the sliders and the hooks for the soft tie bow ties, are made out of cow horn for my newest collect. Cows are a big part of our culture here in terms of dowry and sustenance and history. CNN: Style icons? MR: I'd say Ozwald Boateng. Reading his story, it's just fascinating and he's also African, originated from Ghana. His unique use of color while intertwined with his personal experience and history with British tailoring -- he's up there for my style icons. CNN: With you being a new startup, which designer label would you most like to emulate? MR: Burberry. They remain contemporary and release collections like every other designer but there is a strong sense of heritage and history there that I really admire. CNN: Do you have a favorite piece from your latest collection? MR: I've been figuring out how I can recreate the experience of going to your tailor and having something made for you and recently I partnered with a company called "Full Circle" based here in Rwanda and we've been developing an app. There's a special collection of bow ties I'm making right now and what will happen, the box will have a QR code and when you scan the QR code you can see your bow tie being made. CNN: Cool combination of combining tech to the label. MR: It's also bridging that gap between the customer and the person making the product in a way that I haven't really seen being done before. And for me that's really amazing that half way across the world my customers would be able to see the working conditions, be able to almost have a personal connection with both the brand and the person that made the product. I think it will be really cool. CNN: So who'd you most like to see wearing your designs on the red carpet? MR: Celebrities who are bold. Celebrities who are fearless and have a real sense of self. A few of the names that come to mind are; Pharrell, Janelle Monae, Samira Wiley, Idris Elba, Serge Ibaka, Tinie Tempah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael K. Williams. CNN: Right, last question: what advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs? MR: You have to take that leap of faith, if you feel so strongly about it then do it. I feel like if you feel strongly enough about something you will do it. It doesn't matter if you're an extravert, introvert, you will start something.

            <title>Ebola outbreak: Liberia has shortage of body bags - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T08:12:36Z</date>
            <author>Faith Karimi, CNN</author>
            <highlights>Ebola has killed at least 4,493 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, WHO says Liberia is short of supplies needed to fight the virus Items lacking include protective suits, gloves and goggles The grim inventory highlights how ill-equipped the nation is to fight Ebola</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- As the world reels from its worst Ebola outbreak, the nation hardest hit is declaring a shortage of body bags, which are crucial to preventing the spread of the deadly virus. Liberia, one of three countries most affected by the outbreak, said it has 4,900 body bags nationwide. It needs 85,000 more in the next six months, the Health Ministry said in a statement. A grim inventory of supplies shows body bags were not the only items lacking. Liberia is also experiencing a shortage of other supplies needed to fight the virus, including protective suits, face masks, gloves and goggles. Liberia said it needs 2.4 million boxes of gloves in the next six months, but it has only 18,000 boxes. Each box has 100 pairs. It also needs about 1.2 million hooded overalls within the same time frame, but it has only 165,000. The numbers are the latest setback in Liberia's fight against Ebola, which has killed at least 2,458 people in the nation. This week, health workers in the nation went on strike to demand higher pay, leaving some clinics unattended. Since the outbreak started in March, about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. And the numbers are expected to skyrocket. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the World Health Organization said. It warned that things will get worse before they get better. Liberia has some supplies arriving in the next week, but it says they are still insufficient. Items scheduled to arrive don't include body bags. In addition to the three nations, a handful of Ebola cases have also been reported in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.

            <highlights>Rwandan student was living in Portland, U.S. when he came up with the idea for House of Tayo An accessories brand that accentuates African color, textiles and fabric into Western pieces Despite no formal business training, Rugamba has struck a chord with the fashion fans</highlights>
            <text>Every week, African Start-Up follows entrepreneurs in various countries across the continent to see how they are working to make their business dreams become reality. Kigali, Rwanda (CNN) -- The dandy look has long been associated with the style of the quintessential gentleman. It's elegant and sophisticated with sharp lines and immaculately tailored suits. But certain gentlemen in various parts of Africa have now taken the look to the next level. These dapper dressers can often be seen strutting down the streets of Kinshasa or Brazzaville, as is the case with the Congo's "sapeurs." And now, thanks to up-and-coming "Afro-dandy" designer Matthew Rugamba, the look has also emerged in the Rwandan capital of Kigali -- but with a more local twist. Classy and elegant, Rugamba's label House of Tayo combines bold African patterns and textures with western accessories to produce wax-print bow ties, colorful pocket squares and infinite scarfs for "Afro-dandies" in Rwanda and beyond. We sat down with sartorially chic Rugamba to chat all things dandy: how to get the look; African influences; style icons and who he'd most like to see don his designs. CNN: Tell me what you mean when you describe the House of Tayo style as "Afro-dandyism?" Matthew Rugamba: It hits the nail on the head for my style and what I try to do with my pieces. The additional use of color, patterns, texture -- it's uniquely African. Then going to boarding schools -- you had to have your shirt tucked in, tie done. So many different influences have had an impact on me and helped me deliver my personal style which I have integrated into House of Tayo. CNN: And what's this different side of Africa that you want to show? MR: One of the reasons I started House of Tayo was because I was actually going to school in the United States, and I had so many questions about how life is in Rwanda. Many people had these negative assumptions. They had notions of how bad life was here, poverty, war. And it used to bug me a lot. CNN: So you got sick of telling your friends they were wrong all the time? MR: Not necessarily my friends because I talk to them all the time. Just different people. It could be as random as the coffee shop conversation while you're waiting in line, those were the bits and pieces that would get under my skin. At least with my friends i could say, "Guys, come on! Let me show you pictures. You could visit me."And it was just this other ... you sit in a classroom and there is a limit to the amount of times you can correct people or even just if you are meeting someone for the first time, you're not going to go into this tirade of why you believe that their perceptions were wrong. CNN: Fair enough. Well what about House of Tayo showcases the styles and influences from Rwanda, then? MR: I think it's not necessarily Rwanda alone because I also lived in a couple of African countries, but I feel like general use of color, variation and also the presentation. Also the fact that its made in Rwanda and I'm using bits and pieces that are sourced locally. One of the things that I started doing, the sliders and the hooks for the soft tie bow ties, are made out of cow horn for my newest collect. Cows are a big part of our culture here in terms of dowry and sustenance and history. CNN: Style icons? MR: I'd say Ozwald Boateng. Reading his story, it's just fascinating and he's also African, originated from Ghana. His unique use of color while intertwined with his personal experience and history with British tailoring -- he's up there for my style icons. CNN: With you being a new startup, which designer label would you most like to emulate? MR: Burberry. They remain contemporary and release collections like every other designer but there is a strong sense of heritage and history there that I really admire. CNN: Do you have a favorite piece from your latest collection? MR: I've been figuring out how I can recreate the experience of going to your tailor and having something made for you and recently I partnered with a company called "Full Circle" based here in Rwanda and we've been developing an app. There's a special collection of bow ties I'm making right now and what will happen, the box will have a QR code and when you scan the QR code you can see your bow tie being made. CNN: Cool combination of combining tech to the label. MR: It's also bridging that gap between the customer and the person making the product in a way that I haven't really seen being done before. And for me that's really amazing that half way across the world my customers would be able to see the working conditions, be able to almost have a personal connection with both the brand and the person that made the product. I think it will be really cool. CNN: So who'd you most like to see wearing your designs on the red carpet? MR: Celebrities who are bold. Celebrities who are fearless and have a real sense of self. A few of the names that come to mind are; Pharrell, Janelle Monae, Samira Wiley, Idris Elba, Serge Ibaka, Tinie Tempah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael K. Williams. CNN: Right, last question: what advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs? MR: You have to take that leap of faith, if you feel so strongly about it then do it. I feel like if you feel strongly enough about something you will do it. It doesn't matter if you're an extravert, introvert, you will start something.

            <highlights>Ojeikere was a Nigerian photographer who passed away in February Throughout his life, he took thousands of pictures cataloging the changing times of his nation Monograph from Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos will showcase the work</highlights>
            <text>African Voices is a weekly show that highlights Africa's most engaging personalities, exploring the lives and passions of people who rarely open themselves up to the camera. Follow the team on Twitter. (CNN) -- A young woman stands against a crisp black backdrop. The photographer walks forward and gently turns her away from the camera. Today the focus is not on her face but on the delicate architectural feat that sits atop her head. It seems to almost defy gravity, with light radiating from the hair tower as it spirals upwards in a conical shape. Hairstyles have long been popular fashion statements for Nigerian women. But over the years, the intricate braiding and eye-catching sculptures have often reflected the country's changing sociopolitical times as well. And for the last six decades, one man made it his life's work to capture the complex refashioning of his homeland. In February, the renowned artist J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere died at his home in Lagos aged 84. He left behind a remarkable body of work, much of which is largely unknown outside Nigeria. But now, many of Ojeikere's countrymen are putting in a renewed effort to celebrate the life of the beloved artist -- through documentary films, exhibitions and an impressive monograph of work, Nigeria is presenting J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere to the world one last time. "He started taking images of a nation that was in the throes of development [and] independence in 1960," explains Bisi Silva, the founder and director of the Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos. "We discovered oil, money... modern buildings were going up. So he documented that process, that transition into a modernizing nation." A final wish for a departed friend Over the last five years, Silva has been working tirelessly to complete an extensive monograph on Ojeikere. This has not been yet another project for the art curator -- Ojeikere was a close friend, and the duo had been collaborating on the monograph up until his untimely passing in February. "I had a very close relationship with 'Pa Ojeikere,' as we call him here," says Silva, who turned to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise funds for publishing the book. "I used to speak to him at least once a week." Silva recalls Ojeikere's passion and enthusiasm for the project and, holding it close to her heart, she says she's determined to finish what they had started together. "He was really dynamic, really passionate about photography and there was so much to learn in his archive. Over the last five years, we became friends. He was like a father to me. "It was just such a big shock that he passed away. That he wouldn't see the book he was extremely excited about." Documenting independence Born in a small rural village in West Nigeria in 1930, Ojeikere would become one of Nigeria's most celebrated artists. For over 60 years, the master photographer fastidiously immersed himself in capturing his homeland, documenting every facet of daily life. His many photographs would come together to create a striking anthropological study of Nigeria. The 1950s saw a young Ojeikere searching for a vocation. Rejected by the army, it was an uncle who inadvertently put him on a lifelong journey by suggesting photography. Starting small, the untrained amateur would photograph women in his village as they donned their Sunday best and headed to church. Later on, Ojeikere got a job as a darkroom assistant at the Nigerian Ministry of Information. When he wasn't working, he was often found at the local university, snapping moments between students, staff and events on campus -- once again capturing daily life on film. The country was moving toward a time of social change and political upheaval and Ojeikere explored this through his lens. "You're getting a sort of history of Nigeria at a very important, transitional period, just on the cusp of independence," says Silva. "And just after independence [in 1960], when there is a feeling of euphoria, feeling of liberation, the sense of 'now we can conquer the world, we can develop the nation; we are free, we are independent.' "And this all comes out in the way in which individuals and people presented themselves. It's like: 'Look at me. I'm fashionable, I'm modern, I'm confident, I'm educated. I'm a professional.' All these images amount to a visual image of Nigeria in the 50s, 60s and 70s." Not just hair Ojeikere's next job was working for the national television station, a career move that enabled him to rub shoulders with other creative minds. This is when he started to take photographs with more artistic intent, explains Silva. "He started coming into contact other artists, filmmakers, writers and that's why as he developed, the artistic intent as opposed to the anthropological intent began to develop. When we finally get to 'Hairstyles,' they are actually done in a very specific manner. It wasn't someone on the street. It was in a studio with a specific lighting, with a specific position." The "Hairstyles" series, for which he is so critically acclaimed, features over 1,000 photographs of Nigerian styles since 1954. But for Silva, his work documenting traditional Nigerian headgear and the country's architecture, as well as his studio portrait work, must be examined alongside "Hairstyles" to fully comprehend Ojeikere's legacy. The images communicate a transition from the normal photographs depicting Africa, says Silva. "The images we are used to seeing of Africa -- they gave a one dimensional perspective of a race, of a nation, of a people. It's been a herculean work to bring this publication together." Final tributes Silva's monograph is just one tribute to Ojeikere. Nigerian filmmaker Tam Fiofori recently released "J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere: Master Photographer," a documentary capturing the final year of the artist's life. Elsewhere, an exhibition of "Hairstyles" is currently shown across the UK. Curated by Gillian Fox, it is the first time audiences in the country are having the chance to view Nigeria from this perspective. "As a Nigerian, he wanted to document that moment in Nigeria when it was a time of colonial rule changing over to democracy," says Fox. "He was keen in the wake of modernization to capture something that was quite intrinsic to his culture, his nation and he saw the rate of change that was happening and he thought hairstyles were fascinating and an art form in their own right," she continues. "They were something that should be preserved because the thing about a hairstyle is that they are really ephemeral." She adds: "I think it was a love letter to his country. He used photography which is a very modern medium to document these moments of social change." Click through the gallery above to explore some of Ojeikere's iconic photographs.

            <highlights>Nizar Ibrahim found the most complete skeleton of spinosaurus It's the first known aquatic dinosaur The only other skeleton was destroyed in a bomb raid It's bigger than T-Rex</highlights>
            <text>Every week, Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa, exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures, countries and regions. (CNN) -- Few dinosaurs have as interesting a back story as the spinosaurus. In life, it dominated the waterways -- a 50-foot-long behemoth that employed its blade-like claws and conical, razor-sharp teeth to annihilate its prey. It chomped down on sharks for breakfast. Ninety-five million years after its extinction, this strangely aquatic dinosaur -- the only one of its kind that we know of -- has had to contend with Nazis, bomb raids, armed gangs and mysterious moustachioed men. Its story has all the makings of a spy novel. The most recent chapter in the spinosaurus' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when Nizar Ibrahim, a German-Moroccan palaeontologist from the University of Chicago, uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in Morocco's Sahara Desert. It also happens to be the only remaining skeleton of the species, as all other physical evidence of the spinosaurus was obliterated 70 years ago. "It's a really mysterious dinosaur. (Until now), all we had was little bits and pieces, tantalizing clues and drawings of a partial skeleton that had been destroyed in World War II," explains Ibrahim. Early bones The first, and up until recently only, spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer -- then one of the world's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of North Africa. For years, Stromer unearthed a paleontological treasure trove in the Sahara. "Ernst Stromer was really a very productive scientist. He was an explorer, and he was really the first person to resurrect the lost world of Africa's dinosaurs in a big way," says Ibrahim. Unfortunately, his luck turned with the onset of a war that would rob him of his sons -- two died in battle while the third barely survived a five-year imprisonment -- and his life's work. Most of his finds were stored at a palaeontology museum in Munich. He begged the director to relocate the dinosaur collection, but was refused, and in April 1944, an allied air raid destroyed the institution and Stromer's findings. "Everything went up in flames, and Stromer lost all these incredible finds in a single night," recalls Ibrahim, who considers Stromer his role model. "Resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring Stromer back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology," he says. The man with the mustache Ibrahim's hunt for the spinosaurus began in 2008 when he met a moustachioed Moroccan fossil hunter who was proffering rare-looking samples from a cardboard box. "One piece looked really interesting. It was a blade-shaped piece of bone and I did think at the time that maybe this is a chunk of the spine of spinosaurus," he recalls. Years later, colleagues from the Natural History Museum in Milan showed him similar samples of what they, too, believed was a partial skeleton of a spinosaurus. "It was spectacular. We had leg bones and spines and ribs and skull bones. It was very exciting, but we had a big problem. We had no idea where the skeleton came from, (which) means we don't know anything about the environment the animal lived in, the geological context, or if the bones were found in the same place," he says. With a closer look, however, the bones looked familiar. Ibrahim suspected they not only came from the same site as the specimen he was shown in Morocco, but from the same dinosaur. What followed was a five-year hunt for the man with the mustache -- it was the only detail Ibrahim remembered about the encounter. In 2013, Ibrahim called off the search while sipping mint tea with colleagues in a Moroccan cafe. "I think I was a little naive and very optimistic, and ... we thought, OK, we can't find the guy, so that's the end of our mission impossible. Just like in a bad Hollywood movie, the very moment when I was ready to throw in the towel, a man walked passed our table. The man had a mustache and it was the man I had been looking for." After Ibrahim caught up with him, the man took him back to where he first made the finds. Further excavations dug up even more bones, most likely from the same animal. The collection painted the most complete picture to date of what the animal looked like and how it lived. Mainly, Ibrahim was able to ascertain that spinosaurus was an aquatic dinosaur (a first; previously, there was no known evidence of such a creature). Dense bones -- rare in dinosaurs but common in penguins -- provided the animal with buoyancy in rivers, while a crocodile-like snout helped it both to breathe and sense movement underwater. A seven-foot "sail" on the animal's back helped it navigate through the seas. The findings were published in the journal Science last month, are the cover story of this month's issue of National Geographic, and are also currently the subject of an exhibit at the National Geographic Museum in Washington. The Sahara: Land of giants The Sahara of today can be pretty inhospitable. The land is vast and remote, and offers few visual clues. Temperatures rarely dip below 100 F, and high winds make for some ferocious sandstorms. The sand is also riddled with booby traps: Scorpions, snakes and landmines -- not to mention the odd armed militia doing the rounds -- which tend to keep most palaeontologists at bay. Ibrahim, however, is addicted to the landscape. "The Sahara is a magical place. You'll find fossils of giant fish and river turtles and crocodile-like predators, and that's when it hits you: This place was very, very different 95 million years ago. It was a bizarre world, really like a different planet," he says. In place of the current, seemingly endless expanse of sand, there was a river system that housed all manner of strange creatures. "I call it 'the river of giants.' (There were) giant sawfish and lungfish, flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs." It's a place Ibrahim is eager to revisit. "Let's just say this isn't the last time I travel to the Sahara in search of lost worlds and bizarre creatures," he says.

            <title>WHO: Ebola cases may soar; CDC: Team to help hospitals - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>New site manager at Texas hospital is a "critical role," CDC director says WHO predicts 5,000-10,000 Ebola cases a week in worst-hit countries by December CDC director: A new team will help hospitals around the United States deal with Ebola Dallas nurse: "I'm doing well"; she thanks "everyone for their kind wishes and prayers"</highlights>
            <text>Madrid (CNN) -- It's an ominous number. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday. And now that a nurse has become the first person to contract Ebola on American soil, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has a new plan to help hospitals handle the deadly virus. "For any hospital anywhere in the country that has a confirmed case of Ebola, we will put a team on the ground within hours," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. The response team will include experts in infection control, protective equipment and experimental therapies. A team such as that, Frieden said, might have prevented a Dallas nurse from contracting the disease. The nurse was a member of the medical team that treated an Ebola patient who died last week. "I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the first patient was diagnosed. That might have prevented this infection," Frieden said. "But we will do that from this day onward with any case anywhere in the U.S." In addition to the many experts it sent to Dallas, Frieden said, the CDC "could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands-on with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed. "Ebola is unfamiliar. It's scary," said Frieden. "And getting it right is really, really important, because the stakes are so high." Speaking to reporters in Switzerland, WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Bruce Aylward told reporters that the Ebola outbreak could get worse before it gets better. By December, he said, there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases weekly in West Africa. Compare those December projections to the latest figures. As of Tuesday morning, there were a total of 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths reported to the WHO, Aylward said. The outbreak's mortality rate, he said, is about 70%. "This has been a deadly disease ever since we discovered it in 1976," said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a staff writer at the Dallas Morning News and a former CDC disease detective. "Certainly the death rate can be lowered if we don't have any delays in diagnosis and don't have any delays in treating people," Yasmin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Aylward told reporters that in 90 days, officials have a goal they're aiming for: They want to see the number of cases dropping from week to week. To start to decrease the rate of infection, the WHO says it hopes to isolate 70% of Ebola patients and have 70% of Ebola victim burials performed safely by December 1. Getting responders, facilities and plans in place to meet the goal will be very difficult, Aylward said. Missing the goal will mean that more people will die than should have and that even more resources will be needed because the infection rate will continue to climb, he said. Dallas nurse speaks Days after authorities announced that a Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola, concerns in the United States have focused on a key question: Are people who are putting themselves in harm's way to care for Ebola victims receiving the training and equipment they need? "I've been hearing loud and clear from health care workers from around the country that they're worried, that they don't feel prepared to take care of a patient with Ebola," Frieden said. Every hospital in the United States needs to be prepared to handle Ebola, he said, adding that the CDC will be stepping up training efforts. The Dallas nurse, Nina Pham, had cared for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died of the illness at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. "A single infection in a health care worker is unacceptable," Frieden said. "And what we're doing at this point is looking at everything we can do to minimize that risk so those that are caring for her do that safely and effectively." At least 76 health care workers who may have come into contact with Duncan after he was hospitalized are now being monitored for symptoms of the disease, Frieden said. At the Dallas hospital, teams from the CDC are taking a number of steps to improve safety in handling Ebola, Frieden said, including ensuring there's a site manager making sure protective equipment is put on and taken off correctly. "There wasn't a single individual accountable for that," he said. "That's a critical role and that's there now." They're also improving training at the hospital and limiting the number of staff who go into the isolation area, he said. In a statement Tuesday, Pham thanked supporters for sending kind wishes and prayers, according to the Dallas hospital where she is being treated. "I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world," she said. Infected nurse's assistant 'helping' as doctors treat her Health authorities in Spain said a nurse's assistant who is the first person to contract Ebola in Europe in the current outbreak is still in serious condition but doing better. And even as Teresa Romero Ramos lies in a hospital bed, she's doing everything she can to take care of doctors, nurses and herself, said Dr. Marta Arsuaga, who is Romero's doctor and friend. "She is helping us to treat her. ... She was where I am now, so she knows what I have to do," Arsuaga said. Romero's case, like Pham's, has raised serious questions about how equipped hospitals are to cope with the Ebola outbreak. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said Monday that the Madrid hospital treating Romero doesn't meet all the standards set for centers capable of Ebola care. And in a scathing letter, Javier Limon, Romero's husband, said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled. Romero helped care for one of two Spanish missionaries who were brought back to Madrid for treatment after being infected with the virus in West Africa. Both men died of the illness. Besides treating Romero, Spanish authorities are monitoring 81 potential Ebola cases -- 15 in hospitals and 66 at home, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, the ministry said. Romero is stable but remains in serious condition, Antonio Andreu, director of the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, said at a news conference. A spokesman for a special committee created in Spain to keep people informed about Ebola said Spain will have a contagious diseases reference center in each of its regions. Police, firefighters and ambulance personnel, as well as hospital staff, will be trained to deal with Ebola cases. Andreu insisted that Spain's health care professionals have the situation under control. But he said more training will be given to health care workers and new guidelines will be prepared. "Ebola is not a problem of Spain. It is not a problem of the United States," he said. "It's a global problem."

            <title>Final arguments before Oscar Pistorius sentencing - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-17T08:08:35Z</date>
            <author>Laura Smith-Spark and Emily Smith, CNN</author>
            <highlights>NEW: Judge Thokozile Masipa says court will reconvene for sentencing Tuesday NEW: Prosecutor Gerrie Nel says Pistorius should be sent to prison for at least 10 years Defense attorney Barry Roux says other options besides prison should be considered Pistorius is a "broken man," says Roux, who has "lost everything"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Lawyers painted opposing pictures of South African athlete Oscar Pistorius in their final arguments Friday before his sentencing -- one side depicting him as a broken man who's suffered enough, while the other said he must pay for taking his girlfriend's life. Pistorius, 27, is due to be sentenced for culpable homicide, or negligent killing, as well as one weapons-related charge, after a hearing lasting several days. After both sides' final arguments concluded Friday, Masipa said the court would reconvene Tuesday for sentencing. Defense lawyer Barry Roux appealed to the judge to remember that he reacted as a vulnerable disabled man when he shot Reeva Steenkamp dead. The evidence presented in court demonstrated that as a double amputee, Pistorius' negligent actions in the shooting could not be seen outside the context of his disability, he said. He did not act unlawfully, but out of fear, Roux said. There is no reason to doubt that Pistorius believed there was an intruder in the bathroom who posed a threat to him and to Steenkamp when he fired the fatal shots through the toilet door, Roux said. "Whatever way you see it, the accused's actions were in some way dominated by vulnerability and anxiety," he said. "It's a compromised person doing that." A sentence of imprisonment should be a last resort, and a combination of other options should be considered, he argued. "It can never be a suitable punishment," he said of a prison term. Whatever punishment is handed down, the athlete could not suffer more than in the past 18 months, when he was denigrated, shamed and blamed, on top of losing the woman he loved, Roux said. Pistorius is now a "broken man," he said, who has lost everything he once had. The athlete at times appeared emotional as he sat with his head bowed while the arguments were made over his fate. Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, listened impassively in the benches nearby. Pistorius' sentence -- whether imprisonment or not -- will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa, who also presided over his trial. Prosecutor: 'He's not a victim' State Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, famed for his bulldog tenacity in cross-examinations during the trial, called for a minimum prison sentence of 10 years in his final arguments. This, he said, would be "the minimum term that society will be happy with." "This is a serious matter," he said. "The negligence borders on intent. Ten years is the minimum." He recalled the testimony of Steenkamp's cousin, Kim Martin, who made an emotional appeal for the court to make Pistorius pay with prison for what he did to Reeva and her family. His disabilities had already been taken into account in deciding the verdict, Nel said. He said it was right that the court was shown a bloody photograph of what happened to Steenkamp when she was hit by three of the four bullets fired from Pistorius' high-powered handgun. "It's not an accused that had a gun with normal ammunition that every other person had, it was devastating, damaging Black Talon ammunition," he said. A reasonable man would have known the consequences of firing that ammunition into a small toilet cubicle, he said, recalling that the judge found in her verdict that Pistorius acted negligently, too hastily and with excessive force. Pistorius wanted to use the firearm, he said. "He's not a victim," he said of the athlete. "He cannot be a victim -- he caused it." The victims in the case are Steenkamp and her parents, who had to receive a phone call with the news any parent would dread, he said. Says correctional supervision not appropriate Nel told the court that the sentence of correctional supervision -- as suggested by the defense -- is not appropriate in this case. He said it would not be fair if Pistorius were to live in a luxurious house, get to run track, go to the doctor and then do two days a month of community service. This would be shockingly disproportionate to the crime, he said. He read from case law that said society might lose its trust in the system if a lenient sentence is given. And he accused the defense of "only paying lip service" to the gravity of the offense in asking for correctional supervision. If Pistorius had not acted as he did, Steenkamp would be alive today, he said. Pistorius did not have railings in his shower at home, Nel said, as he rejected defense arguments that the accused could not be accommodated properly in prison. He suggested that Pistorius was using his disability "on call." Nel also dismissed Pistorius' offers of financial aid to Steenkamp's family. June Steenkamp referred to that money as "blood money," he reminded the court. The court this week heard that the athlete had offered the money to Steenkamp's parents, but they had decided to reject it. They will also pay back a monthly payment he had been making to them. Nel also suggested that any appeal for mercy by Pistorius was undeserved. The interests of the victims far outweigh the personal circumstances of the accused, he said, as he scoffed at the fact that Pistorius could have made millions were it not for the shooting. 'He's lost everything' By contrast, in his final arguments, Roux presented a picture of a "broken man" who has already suffered enough. Roux said Pistorius should never have been accused of premeditated murder, a charge of which he was cleared at trial. After the charge, Pistorius was subjected to a trial by media, he said. Roux also argued that he should not have been shown that gruesome picture of the woman he loved while in court. "He never, ever even considered that it was Steenkamp behind that door," Roux said. The athlete has fully accepted the court's verdict and shown remorse, he said. "He's lost everything. He was an icon in the eyes of South Africans," Roux said. "On what he has done, what he has achieved, he was denigrated to such an extent that all that was left was a raged killer, a cold-blooded killer, a liar and everything that's horrible. "He lost all his sponsors, he lost all his money. He has nothing, my lady. He hasn't even money to pay for legal expenses. He has nothing left." He sold his last asset, his car, not to try to get a better sentence but to try to make good by helping the Steenkamp family, Roux said, also citing Pistorius' past charitable work. Roux reminded the court that the Steenkamps have said they are neutral as far as sentencing is concerned and do not seek vengeance. Roux said the testimony of Acting National Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise that Pistorius' disability could be accommodated in the hospital section of a prison did not make it an appropriate place for him to be held. Judge to decide sentence There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be down to the judge's discretion. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Oscar Pistorius should "pay for what he has done," says Reeva Steenkamp's cousin Steenkamp family is not seeking revenge, she says, but believes punishment should fit the crime Head of Correctional Services says prison system can handle disabled prisoners Pistorius' sentence will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa at the end of the hearing</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- A cousin of Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead by South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, said Thursday that he should "pay for what he has done" with a prison sentence, as she testified at his sentencing hearing. Kim Martin, the first witness called by state Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, also dismissed suggestions that the double amputee should serve a sentence of house arrest or community service, saying that would not "fit the crime." "This is not easy for me. I really believe the accused, Mr. Pistorius, needs to pay for what he has done," she said, sounding choked with emotion. "My family are not people who are seeking revenge. We just feel that to take someone's life, to shoot somebody behind a door that is unarmed, that is harmless, needs sufficient punishment." READ: Oscar Pistorius is a 'broken man,' psychologist says Martin, testifying for a second day, told the court that initially, she was worried about prison conditions for Pistorius, but when she realized that he'd be treated humanely, she felt he should receive jail time. "Everybody has suffered here, and I think we need to give a message to society that you cannot do this and get away with it," she said. Pistorius' sentence -- custodial or not -- will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa, who also presided over his trial. The Olympian was cleared of murder last month but found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligently killing Steenkamp, when he fired four shots through a toilet door in his home. He said he believed there was an intruder behind the door. READ: Who is 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius? 'It's ruined our whole family' Martin said she was "very fearful of the accused" and had tried to put him out of her mind. "We even made a point of not mentioning his name in our house because I didn't want to spend any energy thinking about him," she said. Defense attorney Barry Roux asked Thursday if Martin was aware that Pistorius had written letters to Steenkamp's family but under advice from his lawyers hadn't given them to the family. He said that Pistorius wants privately to apologize to the family. Martin is the only member of Reeva Steenkamp's family to have testified before the court, though the model's parents, Barry and June Steenkamp, have been present for proceedings. On Wednesday, Martin said that the health of Reeva's father, Barry Steenkamp, has suffered as a result of his daughter's death and that he had a couple of strokes. "It's ruined our whole family. It's ruined Barry and June. Reeva was everything to them," she said. Prisons chief: We can accommodate Pistorius Acting National Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise told the court Thursday that the system would be able to meet Pistorius' needs as a disabled prisoner. Modise said that South Africa's prisons are used to taking in all kinds of prisoners, including juveniles and the elderly, and that there are facilities to deal with every kind of inmate. The prison system deals with 128 disabled inmates on a daily basis, he said When an inmate enters the system, a health assessment is swiftly done to determine whether a prisoner needs a single cell, he said. He insisted that if Pistorius were given a prison term, the hospital section of Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria had the facilities to accommodate his needs. "There should be no doubt in the minds of South Africans that Mr. Pistorius and any other inmate with disabilities will be accommodated properly," he said. Overcrowding is an issue across the prison system, he acknowledged, but has been reduced from a rate of 63% in 2005 to 31% today. Asked about the problems of gangs and violence in prisons, Modise said that more needs to be done to eradicate gangs outside the prison system and that within the system, authorities are dealing with the issue. Roux, in questioning Modise, made the point that whether Pistorius was given a single cell in the hospital section of Kgosi Mampuru would depend on those evaluating his case when he entered prison. However, Modise's testimony indicates that he does not think Pistorius should be held in the general section of the prison, Roux said. He also raised concerns about what illnesses Pistorius could be exposed to in the hospital section -- tuberculosis is a problem in South African prisons -- and the levels of medical staffing. Probation officer Annette Vergeer, who testified earlier in the week, said she did not think that South Africa's prison system could cater adequately to a vulnerable prisoner like Pistorius. READ: What will Pistorius face if he's imprisoned? No minimum sentence There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>WHO: Ebola cases may soar; CDC: Team to help hospitals - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-14T08:34:09Z</date>

            <highlights>New site manager at Texas hospital is a "critical role," CDC director says WHO predicts 5,000-10,000 Ebola cases a week in worst-hit countries by December CDC director: A new team will help hospitals around the United States deal with Ebola Dallas nurse: "I'm doing well"; she thanks "everyone for their kind wishes and prayers"</highlights>
            <text>Madrid (CNN) -- It's an ominous number. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday. And now that a nurse has become the first person to contract Ebola on American soil, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has a new plan to help hospitals handle the deadly virus. "For any hospital anywhere in the country that has a confirmed case of Ebola, we will put a team on the ground within hours," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. The response team will include experts in infection control, protective equipment and experimental therapies. A team such as that, Frieden said, might have prevented a Dallas nurse from contracting the disease. The nurse was a member of the medical team that treated an Ebola patient who died last week. "I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the first patient was diagnosed. That might have prevented this infection," Frieden said. "But we will do that from this day onward with any case anywhere in the U.S." In addition to the many experts it sent to Dallas, Frieden said, the CDC "could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands-on with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed. "Ebola is unfamiliar. It's scary," said Frieden. "And getting it right is really, really important, because the stakes are so high." Speaking to reporters in Switzerland, WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Bruce Aylward told reporters that the Ebola outbreak could get worse before it gets better. By December, he said, there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases weekly in West Africa. Compare those December projections to the latest figures. As of Tuesday morning, there were a total of 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths reported to the WHO, Aylward said. The outbreak's mortality rate, he said, is about 70%. "This has been a deadly disease ever since we discovered it in 1976," said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a staff writer at the Dallas Morning News and a former CDC disease detective. "Certainly the death rate can be lowered if we don't have any delays in diagnosis and don't have any delays in treating people," Yasmin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Aylward told reporters that in 90 days, officials have a goal they're aiming for: They want to see the number of cases dropping from week to week. To start to decrease the rate of infection, the WHO says it hopes to isolate 70% of Ebola patients and have 70% of Ebola victim burials performed safely by December 1. Getting responders, facilities and plans in place to meet the goal will be very difficult, Aylward said. Missing the goal will mean that more people will die than should have and that even more resources will be needed because the infection rate will continue to climb, he said. Dallas nurse speaks Days after authorities announced that a Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola, concerns in the United States have focused on a key question: Are people who are putting themselves in harm's way to care for Ebola victims receiving the training and equipment they need? "I've been hearing loud and clear from health care workers from around the country that they're worried, that they don't feel prepared to take care of a patient with Ebola," Frieden said. Every hospital in the United States needs to be prepared to handle Ebola, he said, adding that the CDC will be stepping up training efforts. The Dallas nurse, Nina Pham, had cared for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died of the illness at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. "A single infection in a health care worker is unacceptable," Frieden said. "And what we're doing at this point is looking at everything we can do to minimize that risk so those that are caring for her do that safely and effectively." At least 76 health care workers who may have come into contact with Duncan after he was hospitalized are now being monitored for symptoms of the disease, Frieden said. At the Dallas hospital, teams from the CDC are taking a number of steps to improve safety in handling Ebola, Frieden said, including ensuring there's a site manager making sure protective equipment is put on and taken off correctly. "There wasn't a single individual accountable for that," he said. "That's a critical role and that's there now." They're also improving training at the hospital and limiting the number of staff who go into the isolation area, he said. In a statement Tuesday, Pham thanked supporters for sending kind wishes and prayers, according to the Dallas hospital where she is being treated. "I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world," she said. Infected nurse's assistant 'helping' as doctors treat her Health authorities in Spain said a nurse's assistant who is the first person to contract Ebola in Europe in the current outbreak is still in serious condition but doing better. And even as Teresa Romero Ramos lies in a hospital bed, she's doing everything she can to take care of doctors, nurses and herself, said Dr. Marta Arsuaga, who is Romero's doctor and friend. "She is helping us to treat her. ... She was where I am now, so she knows what I have to do," Arsuaga said. Romero's case, like Pham's, has raised serious questions about how equipped hospitals are to cope with the Ebola outbreak. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said Monday that the Madrid hospital treating Romero doesn't meet all the standards set for centers capable of Ebola care. And in a scathing letter, Javier Limon, Romero's husband, said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled. Romero helped care for one of two Spanish missionaries who were brought back to Madrid for treatment after being infected with the virus in West Africa. Both men died of the illness. Besides treating Romero, Spanish authorities are monitoring 81 potential Ebola cases -- 15 in hospitals and 66 at home, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, the ministry said. Romero is stable but remains in serious condition, Antonio Andreu, director of the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, said at a news conference. A spokesman for a special committee created in Spain to keep people informed about Ebola said Spain will have a contagious diseases reference center in each of its regions. Police, firefighters and ambulance personnel, as well as hospital staff, will be trained to deal with Ebola cases. Andreu insisted that Spain's health care professionals have the situation under control. But he said more training will be given to health care workers and new guidelines will be prepared. "Ebola is not a problem of Spain. It is not a problem of the United States," he said. "It's a global problem."

            <title>17 new charges against suspected Benghazi ringleader - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>Grand jury hands down 17 more charges against suspected militant Ahmed Abu Khatallah was captured in Libya and transferred to the U.S. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of providing support to terrorists</highlights>
            <text>Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities filed 17 new charges against Ahmed Abu Khatallah, alleging that he was the ringleader of twin 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic and CIA compounds in Benghazi that killed four Americans. A new indictment against Khatallah, 43, provides new details of the attack and what federal prosecutors say was his role in leading 20 armed men in the attacks carried out over more than seven hours. Previously, prosecutors charged him with a single count of providing material support to terrorists. According to the indictment, Khatallah conspired with others "on or before Sept. 11, 2012" to attack the U.S. diplomatic post. "He believed the facility was being used to collect intelligence, that he viewed the U.S. intelligence actions in Benghazi as illegal," the document said. "These additional charges reflect Ahmed Abu Khattalah's integral role in the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, which led to the deaths of four brave Americans," said Attorney General Eric Holder. The indictment doesn't say how much planning was involved, and doesn't account for the possibility that the attack coincided with other attacks elsewhere in the Muslim world that targeted U.S. diplomatic facilities. Republican critics have said the Obama administration failed to take sufficient measures to prevent the attacks. They also criticize officials for initially portraying the terrorist rampage as spinning out from street protests blamed on an anti-Islam movie produced in the United States. Khatallah has pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists and will remain jailed until his trial, a federal magistrate ruled in July. He will be arraigned on the new charges on October 20. Ten of those charges, including murder, could carry the death penalty. Authorities contend that Khatallah is a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault. Khatallah remained free for more than a year after the attacks, doing interviews with CNN and other media, prompting criticism of the Obama administration over how long it was taking to arrest the alleged attackers. He was arrested in a military raid in Libya in June and charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., mere yards away from Capitol buildings where he has become the center of political controversy. Assistant Attorney General for national security John Carlin said in a statement Tuesday that the case "highlights our resolve to find and hold terrorists accountable wherever they may hide." Prosecutors say the attack in Benghazi began around 9:45 p.m. with Khatallah and about 20 armed men attacking the main gate of the diplomatic mission. They set fire to buildings and Khatallah and others allegedly turned away emergency responders. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and Sean Patrick Smith, a mission employee, perished from wounds suffered in that attack. The attackers retreated briefly around 10:15 p.m., according to the indictment, and then an hour later launched another attack on the mission's southern gate. They used assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades and other explosives. The attackers plundered what they could from the compound, then shortly after midnight, the indictment says Khatallah and others retreated to a camp operated by Ansar al Sharia. Khatallah then led the attacks on the CIA annex beginning at 12:30 a.m. and again at 5:15 a.m., according to the indictment. Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, security officers at the CIA annex, were killed. At a July hearing, defense lawyers contended the Justice Department hasn't provided evidence to support the case.

            <title>Pistorius paid money to Steenkamp's parents, court told - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-14T15:43:18Z</date>

            <highlights>Probation officer: Pistorius has been making monthly payments to Steenkamp family Prosecutor says Reeva Steenkamp's parents will pay the money back Pistorius is too vulnerable as a disabled person to be sent to prison, probation officer says The athlete's sentencing hearing could last several days</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius has been sending the family of Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he fatally shot last year, a monthly payment since March 2013, a probation officer told his sentencing hearing in South Africa on Tuesday. Probation officer and social worker Annette Vergeer told the court that Pistorius' legal team had told her about the payments, of 6,000 rand (about $540) a month, and she suggested that this showed remorse. She said Pistorius had offered the family more besides the monthly payments. The athlete sold his car for about $35,000 and had that money given to the Steenkamp family, she said. Pistorius' manager, Peet van Zyl, facilitated the monthly payments from Pistorius' bank account. However, the Steenkamp family has rejected the money, the court heard. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said that Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, had said she didn't want "blood money." He told the court that Steenkamp's parents had said they would repay the monthly payments in full. The Steenkamp family, through a lawyer, told Vergeer that it was "neutral" on the sentencing phase of the trial, Vergeer said. She told the court that neither of Reeva Steenkamp's parents would testify for the state at the hearing. Pistorius 'vulnerable' in prison Judge Thokozile Masipa, who presided over Pistorius' high-profile trial and delivered the verdict last month, will decide his sentence, which may or may not see him spend time behind bars. The hearing, which began Monday, is likely to take several days, as the prosecution and defense put their arguments before the court. Vergeer argued that Pistorius should not be sent to prison, saying that as a double amputee, he would be vulnerable to gang rape -- particularly if his prosthetic legs were taken away. Nel suggested that if Pistorius were allowed to keep his prosthetic legs while in prison, he'd be fine. But Vergeer said that even if the court allowed Pistorius to keep the legs, there was no guarantee the order would be complied with. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. However, the judge cleared him of murder in Steenkamp's death and granted him bail pending the sentencing hearing. 'Broken man' On Monday, a psychologist said Pistorius was a "broken man" after the death of his girlfriend, as his defense tried to convince a judge of his fragile emotional state. Dr. Lore Hartzenberg said the Olympian described Steenkamp as the love of his life. He lost faith in himself and his abilities after the killing, she said. But the prosecution dismissed her findings. "We're dealing with a broken man, but he's still alive," Nel said in an apparent reference to the fact that Steenkamp is not. "He has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that." Sentence hard to predict There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. CNN's Robyn Curnow contributed to this report.

            <highlights>NEW: Oscar Pistorius "will be able to love somebody else," prosecutor says The judge in his case cleared him of murder but found him guilty of culpable homicide There is no legal minimum or maximum term for culpable homicide Pistorius will also be sentenced on one weapons-related charge involving a restaurant shooting</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius is a "broken man" after the death of his girlfriend, a psychologist said Monday, as his defense used a sentencing hearing to try to convince a judge of his fragile emotional state. Dr. Lore Hartzenberg said the Olympian described his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, as the love of his life. He lost faith in himself and his abilities after the killing, she said. But the prosecution dismissed her findings. "We're dealing with a broken man, but he's still alive," Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said in an apparent reference to the fact that Steenkamp is not. "He has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that." What would Pistorius face if he's sent to prison New woman? Nel questioned the psychologist about a woman the Olympian allegedly started seeing after the death of his girlfriend. Hartzenberg said she's not aware of his new relationship, and the two never discussed it during their sessions. The onetime South African sporting hero was found guilty of negligent killing last month in Steenkamp's death. The hearing that will determine whether he's going to prison began Monday and is scheduled to continue Tuesday. Joel Maringa, a social worker at the South Africa Department of Correctional Services, recommended "correctional supervision" rather than prison time. His report was at the request of the defense. Guilty of culpable homicide Judge Thokozile Masipa, who presided over Pistorius' high-profile trial and delivered the verdict last month, will decide his sentence. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. However, the judge cleared him of murder in Steenkamp's death and granted him bail pending the sentencing hearing. The hearing is likely to take several days, as the prosecution and defense put their arguments before the court. There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. What would prison life be like? If Pistorius is sent to prison, it's unclear whether his disability would allow him any special treatment. And daily life behind bars probably would not be easy. Born with a congenital abnormality, he had his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday and uses prosthetic limbs to get around. The carbon-fiber blades he used to compete on the track -- before Steenkamp's killing abruptly halted his running career -- earned him the nickname "Blade Runner." During his trial, his defense highlighted his vulnerability when on his stumps and a court-ordered psychiatric assessment found he was depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress and a suicide risk. South Africa's prisons are notorious for overcrowding, which puts a strain on sanitation, ventilation and medical care for inmates. Pistorius probably would receive far better treatment than the average prisoner, as he has throughout the judicial process, said Nooshin Erfani-Ghadimi, project coordinator for the Johannesburg-based Wits Justice Project, a civil society group. Even so, she said, it will not make much difference. "I don't think anyone with a disability necessarily will be able to be provided for at the moment in a way that ensures that they would have the correct medical treatment, that they have the correct physical structures," she said. Steenkamp: model and law graduate with 'wicked' sense of humor 'Conduct was negligent' Pistorius, 27, has always admitted firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, 29, a model and reality TV star. He pleaded not guilty to murdering her in his home on Valentine's Day last year, saying he mistook her for an intruder. But in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat, Pistorius "acted too hastily and used excessive force," the judge ruled last month. "His conduct was negligent" and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one, she said. Who is 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius? Appeals process Pistorius can appeal the verdict or the sentence, potentially to the Supreme Court of Appeal and even eventually to the South African Constitutional Court. The state can appeal only if it believes the judge misinterpreted the law in reaching her verdict. The right to appeal depends on whether, based on the facts of the case, the initial judge or magistrate believes a different court could possibly reach a different verdict.

            <title>For Ebola caregivers, enormous fear, risk and bravery - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>WHO: At least 416 health care workers have contracted Ebola; at least 233 have died Caregivers deal with fear among patients and themselves; many grapple with lack of equipment A Dallas nurse became the first person known to have contracted Ebola inside the U.S. The nurse was treating a Liberian national in Dallas who died from the virus last week</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- They dedicate their lives to saving others, but as Ebola spreads worldwide, health care workers must also focus on saving themselves. An American doctor and a North Carolina missionary working with Ebola victims were the first to bring the deadly virus to the United States when they contracted the virus in Liberia and were flown home for treatment. Now, a Dallas nurse has set a similar milestone, becoming the first person known to have contracted the disease inside the U.S. She was wearing the proscribed protective gear -- gloves, mask and shield -- while recently caring for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan at a Dallas hospital. Duncan died last week. While the Texas nurse remains in isolation, a nurse in Spain who contracted the virus after treating a patient in that country is struggling for her life. There are so many caregivers who've become patients. At least 416 health care workers have contracted Ebola, and at least 233 have died, the World Health Organization reports. In Liberia, the worst-affected country, the virus has killed more than 100 medical workers. Since the Ebola outbreak began -- the worst the world has seen -- doctors and nurses have described working conditions no one should endure. Every single move they make in treating a patient must be perfect. One slip-up -- a torn glove or the smallest splat of infected fluid that gets on them -- could cost them their lives. One provider in West Africa spoke of waking up every morning with a sore throat from constantly breathing in the fumes from chlorine that must be constantly sprayed to kill the virus that is capable of thriving not just in living organisms but on surfaces for some time if conditions are right. Health care workers battle not just a disease but rumors among patients in Africa that Ebola is a myth the government is perpetrating. In a profession that already demands much emotionally and physically, these caregivers are pushed to the edge in both respects. They have lost friends, colleagues and patients. All this as they beat back their own understandable paranoia and fear. Have I done everything correctly? Could I be next? Caregivers' cry for help Last week, Doctors Without Borders, an independent international organization that helps victims of tragedies in the world's most dangerous zones, said that a Norwegian staffer had contracted Ebola. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was being sent to Europe for treatment. Doctors Without Borders said it's repeatedly asked for help from the international community but "to this date, very little has materialized in concrete action on the ground," its website says. The organization's teams, composed of 3,058 staff working in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal, are seeing "critical gaps in all aspects of the response, including medical care, training of health staff, infection control, contact tracing, epidemiological surveillance, alert and referral systems and community education and mobilization." In September, CNN visited Bomi County, Liberia, where there were only two doctors covering its 85,000 residents and trying to care for Ebola patients in a 12-bed facility that wasn't even a proper Ebola treatment center. A nurse inside a Monrovia clinic wore a camera showing his job, revealing that he worked inside a clinic with seemingly unclean conditions. Patients were lying on stretchers on floors that appear filthy, and there were open buckets lying around with objects and substances in them. The situation for caregivers across Liberia has become so dire that nurses are now are threatening to strike. Just days ago, CNN's cameras captured crowds of caregivers yelling outside Liberia's largest Ebola treatment center in Monrovia. Underscoring the serious consequences of a Liberia without health care workers, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf arrived to try to calm the crowd. "We're trying to meet all their needs, and we'll continue to do that," she told CNN, struggling to be heard above the shouting. "I don't want to strike," one caregiver said, telling CNN that he foresees deaths increasing several thousand-fold if facilities' conditions don't improve. "But the President has to listen to the massive health care workers out there," he said. "There are angry people. You don't want to have angry people knocking on your doors during this kind of emergency situation." This weekend, The Washington Post detailed horrific conditions at a Monrovia Ebola facility where one doctor died from Ebola and another tested positive for the virus. The Post reported: "Doctors put on their protective gear in the kitchen. There is no incinerator, so a 10-foot pile of Ebola-laced garbage and excrement sits in the back yard. There is no morgue, so bodies sometimes decay outside, next to where patients sit in white lawn chairs. There are no protective hoods for the full-body medical suits," so caregivers make their own. There have also been questions about how tight security is at health care centers. In August, CNN reported that an Ebola treatment facility in Monrovia was overrun by an armed mob who stole mattresses and equipment. Ebola patients fled, local authorities said. A legacy of self-sacrifice The mother of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale, suffered for her dedication to treating patients during the Crimea War. It's believed that she also contracted a bacterial infection as she treated the wounded, dealing the effects of the illness for much of her life. Just as Nightingale was revered as a hero, so too was Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, a top doctor from Sierra Leone who specialized in Ebola. He died in late July from the virus. He had been overseeing Ebola treatment at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown. Doctors Without Borders was treating him. If Khan could get sick, then any other caregiver could, wrote Dr. Oliver Johnson from King's College London, who treated Ebola patients this summer. Read more: Ebola's frontline -- battling fear and the deadly virus Even before the Ebola outbreak, Sierra Leone had already been suffering from a shortage of doctors, nurses and infrastructure, he said. The jobs of health care workers were made all the worse when they attempted to track and monitor the contacts of infected people because roads were difficult to traverse. Crowded housing made the effort even more difficult, he said. Yet even with the best medicine in the most modern facilities does not guarantee safety. The nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas who has Ebola had "extensive contact" at the same hospital with an Ebola patient who died last week, health officials said. The woman had on a gown, gloves, mask and a shield when she visited the patient multiple times, they said, but there was a breach in treatment protocol. Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not detail what that breach might have been. But Frieden did say that merely taking off protective gear is "a major potential area for risk" if not done meticulously, and officials are investigating whether that's what might have caused the nurse to become infected. Hours after Frieden spoke, nurses who are part of the union National Nurses United gathered in Oakland, California, for their own news conference. Holding up signs that said "Stop blaming nurses. Stop Ebola," they blasted the notion that they would be at fault. Her voice rising as she spoke, Katy Roemer, a 20-year nursing veteran, said that colleagues throughout the United States. have reported to the union that they are not being adequately trained to recognize and care for Ebola patients even though they have asked employers for that. "They have not given us this information," she said. Enormous pressure and risks What does it feel like to know you're going to treat a patient with a disease that kills 90% of its victims? What is it like to have never before dealt with Ebola, but know that a patient is about to land in your hospital under your care? "There was no way to fully prepare for the pressure, the national focus, the immensity of being responsible for curing a patient whose deadly disease was at the center of global debate," wrote Angela Hewlett in The Washington Post. The infectious disease physician is an assistant medical director for the Nebraska Biocontainment Patient Care Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center where she treated American Dr. Richard Sacra. Sacra, who had worked as a missionary in Liberia, was treated in isolation at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and then released after testing negative for the virus. She wrote about going through drills and training and about feeling nervous before he arrived. She talked with her family about what they might experience from people judging or making comments born of ignorance and fear about the virus. She also illuminated the difference between a doctor who able to connect and comfort a patient through touch by placing a hand on an arm. Establishing that calm and assurance is a vital and human part of being a caregiver. But Ebola takes that from nurses and doctors. It is interrupted by bulky gear. The key to not getting Ebola, after all, is to keep those suffering separate from others. And yet nurses and doctors continue their work out of practical necessity and because it's their commitment and passion and because, as Hewlett noted, they are fascinated by how medicine might defeat a virus that's considered a global threat. And for some in West Africa, it really is a matter of survival. "What's else can we do? If we don't do it, who will do it for us?" one Liberian nurse told CNN. "So we have to take the risk and care for the patients or else our country will be wiped away." Read more: Cuban doctor train to fight Ebola CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.

            <highlights>At least 10 people have been killed in a car bombing in Mogadishu, police say The explosion happened outside a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital 15 others are wounded; the Al-Shabaab terror group claims responsibility</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- A car packed with explosives blew up outside a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital Sunday evening, killing at least 10 people, police said. Fifteen others were wounded in the blast in the heart of Mogadishu, senior Somali police Officer Farhah Aden said. He said the death toll could rise, since many of the victims were seriously injured. The car was parked at the gate of the Oromo restaurant before it was detonated, Aden said. The hotel is popular with Somalian government officials and is just a few kilometers from the country's parliament compound. An eyewitness said he saw a ball of smoke rising into the sky after the explosion. "I was inside the restaurant at the time of the blast," Ibrahim Mohamed said. "I heard a loud sound of an explosion from the gate of the building and went outside, where I saw dead bodies lying on chairs they were sitting down in, using the Internet." The Al-Shabaab terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the spokesman for the group, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab. Last month, the group's leader was killed in an American airstrike. Intelligence reports at the time indicated the group was planning new attacks after the death of Ahmed Godane.

            <date>2014-10-10T16:52:59Z</date>
            <highlights>Guinea star Alhassane (Lass) Bangoura withdraws from national squad Bangoura cites fears of his Rayo Vallecano club teammates over Ebola Guinea due to play against Ghana in Morocco "I am fine" Bangoura says when asked about his health</highlights>
            <text>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook (CNN) -- Guinea international Lass Bangoura pulled out of a key African Cup of Nations match against Ghana Saturday because his club teammates were worried he could contract Ebola. Bangoura, who plays for Rayo Vallecano in Spain, told the La Liga side's official website that he had been told of their fears in a phone call while training for the Group E qualifier. With Guinea one of the worst affected countries by the deadly virus, the international match had already been moved to the Moroccan city of Casablanca, but that apparently did not satisfy his fellow Rayo squad members. "My teammates were afraid and at the end of practice I spoke with the (Guinea) coach Michel Dussuyer and said there was a problem, because of Ebola. "I asked him if I could be excused because I didn't want any problems with the club, because they are the ones who pay my salary," he said. Bangoura has now returned to his club, who are based in the Spanish capital Madrid where earlier this week a nurse became the first person in Europe to contract Ebola outside of West Africa. She remains critically ill in hospital. "My Rayo teammates welcomed me back," Bangoura said. "They have confidence in me, but what people need to understand is that when you are summoned for the national team, you have to see a doctor and get tested. "Every national team has its own doctor who takes care of these issues. I am fine, there is no problem (with my health)," he added. The 22-year-old Bangoura is a regular in the Rayo first team and has also established himself in his national squad. He was concerned that his withdrawal could lead to problems for his family back home in Guinea. "I just spoke to my mother, we have been talking. It is the first time I have left the national team and I am scared that there could be some crazy person who harms my family. "This afternoon I'll be speaking on my country's radio to say I have no issue with the national team and to say I'm sorry." The spread of the Ebola virus has had a serious impact on football in affected countries, with all competitive games stopped in Sierra Leona. African Cup of Nations qualifiers involving its national team, Guinea and Liberia have also been relocated by the Confederation of African Football.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Dandong is a thriving Chinese border town within throwing distance of North Korea Much trade -- legal and illegal -- is done between the two countries One smuggler talks to CNN about the business he does with N. Korean soldiers But he claims Dandong is crawling with North Korean spies</highlights>
            <text>Dandong, China (CNN) -- The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea. Revolutionary music pumped through loudspeakers wafts over to China. Back across the river, work groups can be seen stirring for a day's toil in the fields. Over here in China, a tourist tout is trying to sell us North Korean currency. "Good price!" he shouts. This is daily life in Dandong, China -- a thriving border town within throwing distance of the Hermit Kingdom. Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards. Signs all along the border warn against throwing goods over the fence, as if it's some kind of zoo. And, in a way, that's what it has become. Chinese tourists now flock to Dandong -- which lies along China's western border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- to ogle at their unfortunate neighbors. Some pay a few RMB to borrow binoculars to peer across the river, while the more adventurous take speedboats and pleasure cruises out on the river, which acts a natural barrier between the two neighbors. "Go inside North Korea!" a sign for one local boat company proclaims. Perhaps the Chinese come to marvel at how far they have come. With decades of breakneck growth, Communist China has become a testament to capitalism and urban living. North Korea, which also describes itself as a socialist state, is still sealed and secretive -- almost. Lifeline Dandong is the lifeline, say critics, of the autocratic regime led by Kim Jong Un. Whole neighborhoods in the back streets of the city are lined with trading shops quietly run by North Korean officials. China is North Korea's largest trading partner by a long way, and despite Beijing's official displeasure with the DPRK's pursuit of nuclear weapons, this trade continues to grow. China has rebuffed any attempts to strengthen economic sanctions further against Pyongyang. READ: Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Up to 70% of all China trade with North Korea runs through Dandong, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and it takes the form of both legal trade and illegal smuggling. We meet "Chen," a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers. "In China we don't lack food, we don't lack things," he says. "People can eat and have clothes on their backs, but not over there, even the North Korean soldiers have nothing." Despite North Korean propaganda that paints a picture of their military as an elite fighting force, Chen says the soldiers are desperate for basic food such as bread and rice. They don't have money so they barter with scrap metals, old pots and even ginseng. But Chen says he can never trade with ordinary North Koreans, the soldiers wouldn't allow it. North Korean spies We can't use Chen's real name, he claims that Dandong is crawling with North Korean spies. "Don't say anything sensitive around the North Korean waitresses," he whispers to us. "They speak Korean and English." And you can find them all across Dandong in North Korean themed restaurants, karaoke bars, and musical review shows. We head to one of the more famous ones along the river. If refugees are caught trying to escape from North Korea, they are shot, but in restaurants like this gaudy two-story tourist trap, North Koreans are allowed to work in China on special three-year permits. They are often the children of mid-level Korean Workers' Party loyalists and their movements and earnings are tightly controlled. And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.

            <title>Mapping the reefs of the Coral Triangle - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-17T01:07:51Z</date>

            <highlights>The Coral Triangle is home to 75 percent of all known coral species in the world Researchers are using a special camera with a propeller attached to it to map the reefs About 40 percent of the world's corals have been lost in recent decades due to climate change and human activities</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- A team of scientists has just finished what might literally be described as one of the most breathtaking jobs in the world -- surveying and mapping the coral reefs in Southeast Asia's Coral Triangle off the coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi Island. As part of the Catlin Seaview Survey, teams from the University of Queensland, Indonesia's Sam Ratulangi University and Indonesia's Institute of Sciences spent time underwater over several weeks near the city of Manado to record data and map reefs in what the survey says "could become one of the last refuges on Earth for coral reefs." The effort was part of a larger project to map the Coral Triangle, which encompasses 647 million hectares of land and sea located within the territories of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. "Coral Triangle" refers to a roughly triangular shape of waters between the Pacific and Indian oceans. One of the world's most crucial breeding grounds for marine biodiversity, it's home to 75 percent of all known coral species, including nearly 600 species of reef-building corals and 3,000 species of reef fish. The Catlin Seaview Survey says the scale of its undersea mapping project is unprecedented. Located on the island of Sulawesi, Manado is the capital of Indonesia's North Sulawesi province. Coral devastation According to experts, about 40 percent of the world's corals have been lost in the last three decades due to climate change and human activities. Assuming the current rate of decline remains steady, some marine biologists predict that most of the world's remaining coral will disappear by the middle of the century. MORE: Into the deep: World's 50 best dive sites The Catlin Seaview Survey got underway in September 2012 on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Centering on the waters of Southeast Asia, the 2014 campaign commenced in April and has also covered areas around Apo Island and Tubbataha Reefs in the Philippines, Komodo and Bali in Indonesia, and East Timor. Located in the center of the Coral Triangle, Manado is a crucial section for researchers. "Regions like Manado in the Coral Triangle could, by the middle of the century, be one of the only places on Earth where coral reefs will exist," says Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, chief scientist of the survey and director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. "Understanding the structure and function of such reefs is of the utmost importance if we are to underpin their resilience to global change." "This information is necessary to make informed decisions about how much, and where, governments should invest to ensure the future well being of our planet," says Stephen Catlin, chief executive of Catlin Group Limited, a Bermuda-based insurance company that sponsors the survey. READ: Dare to dive into the world's deepest pool? How coral reef maps are made The coral mapping effort employs a Seaview SVII underwater camera, which has a rod and propeller attached to the back to create a sort of photo scooter. Three digital SLR cameras encased in the SVII's globe-shaped lens capture high resolution, 360-degree images of reefs. Designed by Catlin Seaview Survey, the camera's new technology helps shorten surveying time of large, shallow water areas from months to days. Officially called the South East Asia Expedition: Survey 4, the survey around Manado, which concluded this week, covered up to 80 linear kilometers of reef, and comprised 40 two-kilometer transects. To map such a vast area, scientist-divers took photographs while "riding" the camera at an average depth of eight meters while traveling at 4 kph. Thousands of images will eventually be stitched together to create a whole picture of the reef system. The images will be uploaded for viewing on the company's database, The Global Reef Record. Some of the images can be found on Google Maps. The team will begin mapping a section of the Coral Triangle in the Solomon Islands later this month.

            <highlights>Uyghur photographer wants to dispel stereotypes about Xinjiang. The Chinese province has become associated with Islamic terrorism. Kurbanjan Samat has taken more than 500 portraits. He hopes to reflect the real lives of people from the province.</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Kurbanjan Samat, a 32-year-old Uyghur photographer, wants to dispel the stereotypes he says many Chinese hold about people from his home region -- an ethnically diverse province in China's far west. He traveled to more than 20 cities to interview and photograph more than 500 people as part of a photography project called "I'm from Xinjiang" that aims to bridge the gap between China's Han majority and the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs at a time of heightened tensions between the two groups. Following the conviction of Uyghur extremists for a number of violent attacks in the past year, Samat told CNN that many Chinese outside Xinjiang increasingly associate the province with terrorism. "The idea occurred to me to tell the real life stories of people from Xinjiang... and show that people from Xinjiang are no different from others," he said. A new book will showcase 100 of his best portraits. They include Nefise Nehmat, a Shanghai-based Uyghur lawyer, who is now studying for a master's degree in comparative law at a U.S. university and Zhang Zhiqiang, a Han Chinese adopted by a Uyghur family, who runs a mobile phone business and has converted to Islam. The subjects are shown in a variety of settings -- an office cubicle, praying, in a radio studio and at home, which Samat hopes will dispel a common perception that people from Xinjiang only run kebab stalls or restaurants. Most of the people he approached were willing to have their portraits taken, but some balked at the last minute. Samat, who is based in Beijing and started taking photos in middle school, says he, like other Uyghurs, has faced discrimination, particularly after knife-wielding assailants killed 31 people at train station in Kunming earlier this year -- an attack Chinese media referred to as the country's 9/11. "During those days, I couldn't even get a cab because I have a face typical of Xinjiang people," he said. READ: Four found guilty of railway station knife attacks Samat doesn't expect his book to bring any significant changes but he hopes it will encourage others to understand the people from Xinjiang they encounter in their daily life. Ultimately, he says, he did the project "not for Uyghurs, not for Xinjiang," but for himself. "If I don't do this, the labels they put on Xinjiang people will be put on me. I don't want to be labeled." READ: 12 face execution for deadly July attacks CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <text>(CNN) -- At least 16 people died Friday when a grate over a ventilation shaft collapsed at an outdoor concert in Seongnam, South Korea, an official with the National Emergency Management Agency told CNN. About two dozen people fell some 10 meters (33 feet), according to the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The accident occurred during an outdoor concert at a multipurpose venue called Pangyo Techo Valley, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.

            <title>The waiting game: Refugees live in limbo in Hong Kong&amp;nbsp; - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>Mohammadi Rahman fled Afghanistan as a child He came to Hong Kong to seek asylum in 2007 He helps other asylum seekers in the city to understand their rights and have a voice Cost of living in Hong Kong is high; asylum seekers, who can't work legally, often live in poverty</highlights>
            <text>Hong Kong (CNN) -- On a promenade that runs along Hong Kong's harbor, crowds of tourists jostle for their chance to photograph the city's spectacular skyline. But long after most have retired to their hotel rooms, one small group of visitors remains. The four men, who came from India in search of a better life, say they have been sleeping in the alcove of a building in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui district for almost two months as they wait for their asylum claim to be processed. "Lots of refugees in Hong Kong live in the same conditions," says Mohammadi Rahman, chairman of Refugee Union, a group that advocates for asylum seekers' rights and helps them to find suitable housing in Hong Kong as they wait to learn their fate. It's a feeling that Rahman, 30, knows well. When he arrived in Hong Kong in 2007, he, too, was homeless and slept on the streets for months. For almost eight years, he has been battling what many see as the government's indifference to the plight of refugees. Frustrated by his own struggle against Hong Kong's immigration system after fleeing Afghanistan, he has become a champion for the rights of some of the city's most vulnerable inhabitants. When he was just five years old Rahman fled with his family to Iran after one of his brothers was shot dead during the country's civil war. He worked as an engineer and made enough money to help support his parents, along with his four sisters and three brothers. But he wasn't safe in Iran either, for reasons he won't disclose for fear of putting his family in danger. "The government wanted me dead," he said. If he returns, he believes he will be incarcerated, tortured, or worse. In 2011, after more than three years in Hong Kong, the United Nations recognized Rahman as a refugee. Since then he has been waiting for the organization to find a third country that will take him in. Thousands living in limbo Around 6,000 people are currently seeking asylum in Hong Kong according to the territory's Immigration Department. Refugees cannot work legally, which makes them dependent on the city's welfare system. The lucky few whose claims are successful are resettled to another country. As Rahman can attest it is an agonizing process that can take years. "As long as you don't have a right to work, you don't have anything to live on," says Rahman. "You don't have any future. You can't build your family's future, your kids' future." Authorities provide food parcels three times a month and a rental allowance, but some asylum seekers say the assistance is not enough to cover even their most basic needs. Strength in unity In January this year, Rahman and several dozen others like him founded the Refugee Union. The group advocates for the rights of asylum seekers, gives advice and legal assistance and helps people find accommodation. "We created the Refugee Union to fight ... against the system with more power," he said. "We have to fight together, because whatever I fight, another refugee is fighting for the same thing -- they suffer from the same thing." In recent months, the group has held peaceful demonstrations in the heart of Hong Kong's business district to raise awareness of their concerns and put pressure on authorities. "Most of the refugees are afraid to complain, because they think if they complain, immigration will process their application faster and will reject them, (or) will cut their welfare allowance," Rahman said.  Since Refugee Union began its campaign, the government has increased asylum seekers' food and rent allowance, and given them additional funds for transportation, electricity and water. Rahman says that the total assistance they receive still falls below the city's poverty line. "The Refugee Union completely changed the asylum arena by coordinating individual protests into group action," says Cosmo Beatson, executive director of Vision First, an NGO that is giving the group advice and logistical support. "The goal is to empower refugees to speak up for themselves, support each other in solidarity and advocate for the changes that they desperately need because obviously collective bargaining beats solo endeavors." Improving lives In Hong Kong, Rahman lives with his wife in a cramped, one-room apartment that costs HK$2,800 ($360) per month. She earns HK$4,000 ($520) a month working as a domestic helper for a local family, but sends a large portion of her income back to her family in the Philippines. Every day, Rahman reads a sign that his wife has placed near their bed: "Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, but about learning how to dance in the rain." He hopes one day to leave Hong Kong and start a new life. Until then, he is determined to help reform the city's welfare system so that other asylum seekers aren't forced to live "like beggars." "Even though I cannot do work ... it is better for me to give my time for them, to help them to improve their situation in Hong Kong," he said.

            <title>Astonishing origami exhibit bridges art and science - CNN.com</title>

            <author>William Lee Adams, for CNN </author>
            <highlights>A new exhibition in New York showcases the art of origami Those who practice the discipline say it bridges science and art Today, origami artists use software to help them design their intricate creations.</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- When origami enthusiast Uyen Nguyen discusses her art, you quickly understand that it is about a lot more than folding paper. "In many ways it has been therapeutic," she says. "I find the process of folding paper to be almost meditative. "Origami can be used to create incredibly realistic forms, not just to the likeness of say, an insect, but down to the exact species of that particular insect with proportions of its body segment true to real life. At the other end of the spectrum, you can mold paper to create the most abstract of forms beautiful because of their inherent structure instead of their likeness to real life forms. As someone interested in both science and art, I love that origami bridges the two." Worldwide movement Now Nguyen is bringing her passion to the people of New York City. For the exhibition Surface to Structure: Folded Forms, which will take place at New York's Cooper Union from June 19 to July 4, Nguyen has gathered more than 130 works from 88 artists around the world. The exhibition includes adorable rabbits folded by Malaysian origamist Ng Boon Choon, and a realistic rendering of a field mouse by American Bernie Peyton. But it also includes "St. Michael -- The Archangel", a more ominous work by Vietnamese origamist Tran Trung Hieu. It shows a winged angel carrying a sword. The exhibition marks the 55th anniversary of the 1959 exhibition Plane Geometry and Fancy Figures -- the first origami exhibition held in the United States, which also took place inside Cooper Union. So far Nguyen has raised more than $24,000 of the $32,000 she needs to cover the cost of shipping the works, organizing security and building display cases. Collectively the works demonstrate how origami artists are pushing the boundaries of technique and style. Transcending language barriers In the 1950s, Japanese organist Akira Yoshizawa helped popularize the art by creating a universal system of diagramming, which involved arrows and illustrations rather than words. His book allowed people across the world to learn the craft and to easily construct pre-existing designs. But today artists have moved beyond that, with many using software that helps them dream up and then fold their elaborate works. "Most origami involves folding one sheet of paper into some final form," Nguyen says. "Modular origami uses multiple sheets of paper, folded into identical units, and takes these units and interlocks them, without cuts or adhesive, to obtain a final form that is usually very angular and representative of geometric solids. A couple of my designs add embellishments onto the surfaces of these polyhedra." Regional variations in the art are becoming smaller and smaller as more people learn about origami via the Internet. However, Nguyen says that she observed a few patterns among artists while curating her exhibition. Vietnamese artists tend to be masters of wet folding, which creates soft, gentle bends rather than sharp creases. "Their styles can be somewhat minimalist, and there is so much beauty in their simplicity," she says. "The Japanese tend to be more calculated and precise with their folding, which can allow for a huge amount of detail and complexity. I think the European style of origami lies somewhere between these two extremes."

            <highlights>Hong Kong police clear a major intersection occupied by protesters. Up to 600 police stormed the site at dawn, catching protesters off guard. Some protesters remained, blocking southbound traffic. Demonstrators continue to occupy a site in the city's financial district.</highlights>
            <text>Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong police moved at dawn on Friday to clear a major intersection occupied by pro-democracy protesters for almost three weeks, tearing down tents and dismantling barricades. Around 500 to 600 police carrying wire cutters and riot shields stormed the site in the city's busy Mong Kok district, a smaller offshoot of the main downtown protest area, catching the 100 to 200 protesters at the site off guard. Police also used a crane to tear down makeshift structures erected by the protesters. A CNN team at the scene said most protesters did not put up any resistance. Police later said they arrested one 48-year-old man for common assault. University student Adrian Lui, who had been at the protest camp for three days, said he was sleeping when the police moved in. "They were running towards us with shields and at that moment we were nervous. Lots of people got spooked and ran down side streets." Lui said he would stay at the site in the hope that back-up protesters would arrive. Pictures from CNN affiliate iCable Friday afternoon showed a small number of protesters sitting on the street in Mong Kok, preventing traffic from flowing southbound along Nathan Road, a main thoroughfare in Kowloon. In a statement, police said that they had designated an area for protesters on the sidewalk and called for them to disperse. Government offers talks On Thursday, Hong Kong's leader C.Y. Leung said that the government was eager to resume talks with the main student group as early as next week. However, he said the city's tolerance of mass sit-ins was limited and the standoff could not carry on. One of the main student groups, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said late Thursday it was willing to have dialogue but said it hadn't been approached by the government or its representatives. READ: Street blockades cannot continue Protesters continue to occupy a major thoroughfare in Admiralty, close to the city's financial district and government headquarters, but police have chipped away at the area held by protesters this week by removing barricades and opening roads to traffic. On Friday morning, police called on protesters gathering on Lung Wo road, which runs past the central government offices, to disperse. The street was the site of tense clashes on Tuesday and Wednesday night as police used pepper spray and wielded batons against protesters. Smaller numbers At the peak of the protest in early October, tens of thousands of people came onto the streets at three locations in Hong Kong -- Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok -- to call for universal suffrage. But numbers have dwindled as the protests stretched into a third week. Protesters want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress (NPC) has said they'll be able to vote from a shortlist approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Leung said on Thursday that there is no way Bejing would retract its decision. "We have to implement the 2017 election of the chief executive within the framework set by the NPC," he said. He said the move to give each Hongkonger a vote was a "big breakthrough, a big step." Currently the chief executive is elected by a specially-appointed 1,200 member election committee. "I know some people including students feel we can be more ambitious but that's not in accordance with the Basic Law," he said, referring to Hong Kong's mini constitution.

            <highlights>27 bodies have now been found, regional administrator says Another 226 people have been rescued from mountainous areas since Tuesday Three people are confirmed missing, but others appear to be unaccounted for Those killed include Israelis, Canadians, Poles, Slovaks and Nepalis</highlights>
            <text>Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The grim search for missing hikers and bodies buried under snow continued Thursday against the dramatic backdrop of Nepal's Himalayas, as officials confirmed that at least 27 people had died in an exceptionally heavy snowfall. Rescue crews combed the high altitude paths and passes of the popular Annapurna region as well as the neighboring Manang district for missing trekkers. Nine stranded Israeli tourists were rescued Thursday, as well as three Canadians and four Indians who were pulled to safety, according to the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal. The trekkers' group said it deployed helicopters to rescue hikers stranded by snow, floodwaters and avalanches unleashed along the popular Himalayan trekking trails by heavy snow Tuesday. Regional administrator Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya told CNN that 14 trekkers were now known to have died near the iconic 5,416-meter (17,770-foot) Thorung La Pass in Mustang district, the highest point of the popular 21-day Annapurna Circuit trek. The bodies recovered so far include Israelis, Nepalis and Poles, he said. Three remain buried under snow. Even as the total death toll climbed from the 17 reported Wednesday, Thapaliya warned that there are chances of finding more people dead or lost around the pass. A Nepal army team made it up to 16,000 feet -- still short of the pass -- on Thursday on the side of the mountain where the 14 bodies were found. But more could be found in the final 1,800 feet of ascent, officials fear. 'This is the dangerous part' At the same time, there has been no search at all yet on the other side of the pass, which falls in Manang district, Thapaliya said. Friday's search efforts will be concentrated there. "This is the dangerous part," he said. There has been no contact with the remote area even by phone, he said. One Israeli was rescued from near the pass Thursday, having been stuck since Tuesday. Three trekkers have been confirmed as missing, two of them Indian and one Japanese. However, government records suggest another dozen may be missing after taking into account the 14 confirmed dead so far below Thorung La Pass. The chief district officer of Mustang district, Baburam Bhandari, said that on Monday and Tuesday, 346 trekkers had left for the pass and 320 of them had crossed -- leaving 26 people unaccounted for. The pass is not the only area to see deaths due to the unseasonably heavy snow. The bodies of another five trekkers, four Canadians and an Indian, were found in Manang district, Thapaliya said. Three Nepali farmers were also killed. Further west, five mountaineers -- two Slovaks and three Nepalis -- lost their lives in an avalanche Tuesday night near Nepal's seventh highest peak, Mount Dhaulagiri, officials said. Altogether, 320 people have now been rescued as of Thursday, more than half of them from Manang district, said Bhandari. 'There was no visibility' Those who manage the steep ascent at energy-sapping high altitude to the Thorung La Pass are normally rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views. But on Tuesday morning everything changed. Trekkers spend the night at local camps on either side of the mountain before they set out, sometimes as early as 4 a.m., to make the crossing, said Bidur Kuikel of Annapurna Conservation Area project. "On Tuesday heavy snowfall began at about 8 a.m.," he said. "There was no visibility beyond three meters." Since the tracks were covered by snow, people could have fallen down or become lost, he said. Those traveling on their own rather than in organized groups are usually most likely to lose their way, he said. As anxious families wait for news, army and police personnel continued to search the area below the Thorung La Pass in Mustang district on Thursday, Bhandari said. A Facebook page, Annapurna Nepal Avalanche and Blizzard Info Share, has been set up to try to connect worried relatives with those in Nepal. Some trekkers who have made it down from the remote pass have posted updates to help others. One, Virginia Schwartz, wrote: "Thank you to everyone for all the kind words and prayers, we are safe. We are trekking out of the avalanche danger zone and heading back down along the circuit." Another, Nic Brdo from Perth in Western Australia, wrote: "I've just got out of base camp evac'd by heli and would advise to not go up. Flying to Pokhara the amount of snow in the pass (was) astounding." 'Trekking is adventurous' This is already one of the deadliest such tragedies in the history of Nepal, a nation of about 26 million known worldwide for its spectacular mountain ranges, including Mount Everest. Annapurna is far and away the most popular of its trekking areas, with some 90,000 trekking there in 2013, according to Narendra Lama, tourism officer of Annapurna Area Conservation Project. "There have been incidents of trekkers being killed in snowstorms, landslides and avalanches in the past but not as many as this year," Lama said. "But I do not think that this disaster will have a big impact since it is a natural disaster and not about a security situation," he said. "Trekking is adventurous in nature after all." October is the best month of the year to do the Annapurna Circuit trek, meaning more visitors than usual may have been in the area when unusually heavy snow caused by Cyclone Hudhud in eastern India came down Monday and Tuesday. Last year, about 20,000 foreign trekkers crossed the Thorung La Pass, almost 6,000 of them in October, according to Annapurna Conservation Area statistics. Many remote Nepali communities rely on foreign trekkers and mountaineers for income and employment, meaning a drop in visitors could hit local people hard. READ: Survivor recalls how ice tumbled down in Mount Everest avalanche The deaths come only six months after tragedy last struck Nepal, on the slopes of Mount Everest. Then, a bruising avalanche of ice swept 16 Sherpas to their deaths. After the accident, which came right before the peak season in May, many Sherpas refused to climb and at least six companies that lead Everest expeditions called off their 2014 climbs. CNN's Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu, with Laura Smith-Spark reporting and writing in London. CNN's Brian Walker also contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NEW: Hong Kong's leader CY Leung says government open to talks Tells press conference that tolerance of mass occupation was limited He said police had shown tolerance and restraint, despite accusations of excessive force Asia's richest man urges protesters to go home</highlights>
            <text>Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's leader made it clear on Thursday the pro-democracy protests which have clogged main thoroughfares in the city for almost three weeks cannot continue. C.Y. Leung told a live press conference on local television that the government was eager to resume talks with the main student group -- the Hong Kong Federation of Students -- as early as next week. However, he said city's tolerance of mass sit-ins was limited, and that some members of the public were "very discontent." "We do not want to see anyone, including students, continuing to occupy the roads for a long time and creating conflict with the public who are disgruntled. We don't want to see clashes," he said. "We cannot allow the situation to continue to have an adverse impact on Hong Kong society." READ MORE: The end of trust? Growing discontent At times during the near three-week protest, police have been forced to separate protesters from anti-protest groups intent on tearing down makeshift barricades blocking main roads. Taxi drivers and business owners have complained that the protests have cost them income -- at one stage early in the protest, a man threatened to jump off a bridge because his child's school had been closed for days. The protests, which began in late September, have caused severe disruption in the city, impeding access to the city's financial district, forcing the cancellation and re-routing of tram and bus services and putting pressure on the local underground rail network. At the peak of the protest in early October, tens of thousands of people came onto the streets at three locations in Hong Kong -- Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok -- waving cell phones in unison as they called for universal suffrage. However, in recent days numbers have dwindled. The government and protesters had planned to start talks last Friday, but the government pulled out after protesters urged supporters to keep up the blockade. Protest groups then accused the government of not being "sincere" in its offer, and issued another call for reinforcements. What protesters want Protesters want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress (NPC) has said they'll be able to vote from a shortlist approved by Beijing. Leung said on Thursday that there is no way Bejing would retract its decision. "We have to implement the 2017 election of the chief executive within the framework set by the NPC," he said. He said the move to give each Hongkonger a vote was a "big breakthrough, a big step." Currently the chief executive is elected by a specially-appointed 1,200 member election committee. "I know some people including students feel we can be more ambitious but that's not in accordance with the Basic Law," he said, referring to Hong Kong's mini constitution. Claims of police brutality On Wednesday, the occasional scuffle between police and protesters took a darker turn with the release of a video which appeared to show several police officers beating up a detained protester. Hong Kong police have vowed to conduct a full and impartial investigation, and the officers concerned have been temporarily relieved of their duties. Leung said on the whole officers had shown tolerance and restraint during a period of "great stress." The alleged beating victim, Ken Tsang, a social worker in his 30s, lifted his t-shirt to show local media bruising and scratches to his back and chest as he left a police station late Wednesday night. Reading from a prepared statement, he said: "You should have seen the TV footage of a number of police officers brutally assaulting me. I was... utterly defenseless," he said, according to the South China Morning Post. He said he planned to take legal action. Tsang's lawyer Dennis Kwok told CNN his client was already cuffed when six or seven officers carried him to a dark corner and started kicking and punching him. "It was unprovoked and unnecessary for anyone to use that kind of violence on an arrested person," Kwok said. Turf battles For the second straight night on Wednesday, officers and protesters clashed on Lung Wo road, which runs past the central government offices in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong, near the main protest site. Police said they fired pepper spray but only after protesters ignored warnings and tried to charge them. The melee followed the arrest of a 38-year-old man for disorderly conduct after he kicked a bottle into the path of a moving car, police said. The road has been the center of a turf battle between police and protesters, who have been trying to rebuild barricades torn down in previous attempts to clear the way for traffic. Li Ka-shing: Go home On Wednesday, Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, waded into the debate, releasing a statement urging the protesters to go home. "We can all understand the passion of the students. However 'pursuit' must be navigated with wisdom, all people should observe the rule of law -- Hong Kong Police Force has always been guarding law and order, and the damage of rule of law will be the gravest grief for Hong Kong." Addressing them as "young friends," he said the protesters' message had been heard. "I sincerely appeal to all of you not to be emotional, I ask you not to let today's passion become tomorrow's regret, I plead that you immediately return to the side of your family members." CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Jonathan Stayton and Chieu Luu contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>A smartphone app called FireChat has emerged as the messaging tool of choice for Hong Kong protesters The 'off-the-grid' app works by creating its own network outside the internet The company registered 500,000 downloads in Hong Kong alone within two weeks Other emerging services are exploiting the same 'mesh-network' technology</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities available in business and society through technology. (CNN) -- The revolution will not be televised but it will be tweeted, instant messaged or, in the case of Hong Kong, broadcast on mesh networks like FireChat. FireChat -- an 'off-the-grid' smartphone app -- emerged this month as the technological glue holding Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests together and a powerful weapon in the hands of mass movements, dissidents and protesters. The app works by creating its own network outside the internet, relying simply on the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi link that exist between one phone and another. Unlike mobile and internet networks which come under strain and break down the more users tax the system, the more people in a mesh network like FireChat, the better it works. "We were pretty much forced to use it almost at the start of the protests because there were just so many people in the protest areas, it made the cell network so slow," said Pamela Lam, an 'Occupy Central' pro-democracy activist. "FireChat doesn't need data to work -- a lot of people were downloading it." The company that developed the application, Open Garden, initially struggled to keep up with its new-found popularity, adding more capacity as news of the app spread from Hong Kong to rest of the world. Unexpected success For a start-up that only launched in March this year, the numbers were staggering. In the first two weeks of the protests, between September 27 and October 10, the service registered 500,000 downloads in Hong Kong alone (61% on Android and 39% on iOS), 10.2 million chat sessions and 1.6 million chatrooms. "We were not expecting this and we were very surprised," FireChat marketing chief Christophe Daligault told CNN. "We saw this enormous surge in our service and realized something really big was happening. "Now we've seen spikes just about everywhere in the world and there may be two reasons for this. The first is that there are some people who use it to get the latest information about what's happening in Hong Kong and the second are people who just want to see what the fuss is all about." Chinese language users, in particular, have taken to the app, expressing support for the movement from as far away as Australia and the United States. With the buzz now dying down, Daligault said that the volume of downloads was tailing off but activity is trending up and the chat sessions have got shorter as people keep communications focused on important information. "What that says to us is that quite a few people are sticking with it," Daligault said. 'Giant megaphone' Unlike other messaging applications, FireChat is not limited to a user's circle. What goes up on FireChat is available for everybody to see. "It's like a giant megaphone," he said. "You could be in a place and shout I'm in this precise location and we need water bottles right now and someone whom you don't know can answer that message come with those bottles. "That would be harder to do with Facebook or Whatsapp where you're limited by the people you know as far as the reach of your communication is concerned." The co-founder and CEO of Open Garden Micha Benoliel happened to be in Hong Kong on a layover when the protests started and extended his stay to get live feedback on the service. Authentic voices One thing that protesters complained about was that everyone could read the traffic, including opponents of the Occupy movement. Since then FireChat has added a verification component that stamps the messages as coming from a particular user or group. "Apparently there was misinformation being spread on FireChat and people were putting up scare messages to try to convince people to go home," Daligault said. While FireChat became the app of choice in Hong Kong's -- and saw similar success in protests earlier this year in Taiwan -- Daligault said the app was never designed as a messaging tool for protesters. "What we envisioned was a service that would provide communication for people in places where there was poor connectivity and a large population density. Cities such as New Delhi or Mexico City," he said. More options FireChat is now only one of a number of apps -- Serval Mesh, Commotion and Storymaker - that are competing in the mesh-network services space. A Russian mesh-networking app called Telegram was used in South Korea in May after the government announced a crackdown in response to rumors that were spreading on the Korean homegrown messaging sevice Kakao Talk. As many as 35 million people reportedly used the service, which allows users to erase their messages or chats after a certain length of time. Private messaging is now one of the options that FireChat is developing in the wake of the gigantic beta test its service received in the Hong Kong protests. "We are working on adding private messaging with encryption. But this will take months, not weeks," said Daligault. "This is much harder than for other communication apps as we need to make this work off the grid." While FireChat was a useful device for relaying information and encouragement during the early mass protests in Hong Kong, it became less useful once Occupy moved into a game of cat and mouse with the police. "The problem with FireChat is that everyone around you can get your message, including the police," explained Hong Kong-based student Michelle Zheng. "If you're discussing your deployment through FireChat, the police know straight away where your weak links are."

            <title>Inter Milan owner Erick Thohir: Why Italian football needs to change -- or 'die' - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T01:06:21Z</date>
            <author>John Sinnott, CNN</author>
            <highlights>Erick Thohir bought a controlling stake in Inter Milan a year ago Indonesian attempting to revive one of Serie A's leading clubs Inter the second team in Italy's top flight to have foreign owner He warns Serie A will be "dead" if it has to face another corruption scandal</highlights>
            <text>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook (CNN) -- In a city where style is king, a Milanese football giant is in need of an urgent makeover, according to the Indonesian businessman who has taken on the challenge. One of only two overseas owners in Serie A after buying a 70% stake in Internazionale in November 2013, Erick Thohir believes globalization is the key to reviving this grand institution. He remembers Italian football's golden age of the 1990s, but given Serie A's current plight -- corruption scandals, racism, fan violence and dilapidated stadia -- those days seem a distant memory. Even Thohir admits his 15-year-old son is more interested in talking about players from the English Premier League than Italy. His solution is for Italian football to open its arms to the world, arguing there are 260 million potential Inter fans across the globe, with as many as 165 million supporters in Asia just waiting to be reconnected with a league dominated in recent years by Juventus. "Serie A has be to more aggressive," the 44-year-old Thohir told CNN in an exclusive interview, as he laid out his vision to revive his underachieving club. Inter last won the scudetto in 2010 and failed to qualify for this season's UEFA Champions League, though the team is in the second-tier Europa League If Thohir comes armed with ideas to overhaul Inter, he also issues a blunt warning for Serie A, which in recent years has arguably become European football's ugly duckling. "I specifically tell people if we do another Calciopoli, Serie A will be dead," said Thohir, referring to the 2006 scandal when Juventus was heavily sanctioned. "Italy won't be number two, not three, or even fourth. We will be ninth and lose ground to countries like Portugal and Holland. "It's important to look at the world globally and not just Italy. The (other club) presidents are open-minded when we talk. A lot of things have to be done." Inter earns $95 million from domestic and international television rights deals and expects to earn an extra 10% next year, but those sums are dwarfed by the $9.4 billion that the English Premier League's 20 teams share in their latest three-year contract. The 2014-2015 turnover forecast for Inter is $240 million, but again, that's less than half of Manchester United's current $551 million revenue, according to Forbes. "The English Premier League has become bigger and bigger, but Serie A can become the second league in the world," said Thohir. "We still have a good foundation and can compete with Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga." Comparing Serie A with the English Premier League is like chalk and cheese, admits Inter's chief executive officer Michael Bolingbroke, who previously worked for Manchester United and entertainment company Cirque de Soleil before he was appointed by Thohir in July. One of Bolingbroke's first tasks it to increase Inter's home attendances at the San Siro, a stadium the club shares with AC Milan. Last season Inter had the highest average Serie A crowd -- 46,246 -- but given the San Siro's 80,000 capacity that's still a lot of empty seats. On arriving from England, Bolingbroke was surprised to learn Inter had no football museum of its own at the San Siro, though it does share one with AC Milan. United's Old Trafford museum annually has 400,000 visitors who shell out $29 for a visit which also includes a stadium tour, while the joint San Siro museum has 270,000 visitors who pay $21. Inter now hopes to build its own museum. While Bolingbroke crunches the numbers, Thohir wants more top-flight games kicking off at 3 p.m at the weekend to enable a greater number fans in Asia and the United States to watch Italian football. #InterNapoli, prosegue la vendita: da oggi disponibile anche il settore ospiti http://t.co/nUsxpU4F6y #FCIM pic.twitter.com/BDcb0zEV9N "We need to talk to our fans globally," added Thohir. "The beauty of Milan is, as well as football, there's also fashion and culture." With the NBA now playing games in Asia, the NFL coming to Europe and baseball matches taking place in Australia, Thohir is also open to the idea of Serie A matches being played outside of Italy. "A lot of fans in different regions want to see the real live game rather than on their television or computer." Given a similar idea in England has not been openly embraced by a number of Premier League clubs' fans, Thohir might have trouble winning over Italian hardcore supporters, who in the past have proved a stumbling block to reform. However, according to Richard Hall, who writes about Italian fan culture, even the ultras realize things can no longer stay the same. "They know the stadiums are outdated and attendances are suffering and it's not a family event," said Hall, who has written about Inter for the British newspaper The Guardian and U.S. broadcaster ESPN. The ultras see that the English Premier League has "lost part of its soul," according to Hall, who says many Italian fans would prefer Serie A clubs to follow the Bundesliga model, where teams are more closely aligned to their supporters and and represented at boardroom level. "The fans have to trust us, because what we do is good for the club," replies Thohir, when asked if he would consider implementing such a model at Inter. "Italy has the tradition of the president, but we need to be more professional and corporate and still involve the fans to help us grow." Chinese breakfast with @ZanettiOfficial @LuisFigo #interforever pic.twitter.com/mDdXypxRlb In Inter's last two games, the patience of even diehard "Nerazzurri" might have been tested as coach Walter Mazzarri's team capitulated at home to Cagliari and then at Fiorentina. Those two defeats demonstrated just how much work Thohir and his team have to do in resuscitating this ailing Serie A giant, which languishes in 10th place ahead of Sunday's home clash with Napoli. "I'm not looking for personal success," Thohir says. "It's more about how can I work hard, supported by my new team, to make Inter one of the top-10 clubs in the world. With a lot of support and the same vision we can do it." Thohir's decision to acquire a majority stake in Inter with his Indonesian business partner Handy Soetedjo followed investments in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the MLS team DC United. Conscious of the new constraints imposed by Europe's governing body UEFA with its financial fair play system, Thohir wants Inter to use more data and analytics in following the player-buying strategies pioneered by Billy Beane -- the subject of Michael Lewis' book 'Moneyball' -- at the Oakland Athletics. "When we decide a player -- we do it collectively," said Thohir. "We sign on the tactical, financial and commercial side. "This is the model for DC United and it's been pretty sustainable. So far at Inter, we have done OK. We don't want to create bureaucracy and it's important to reduce the risk." Like fashion, football can be a risky business, but for Thohir, criticism is "medicine to him." But will it be the tonic needed to wake Italy's "sleeping giant"?

            <title>Hong Kong vows probe into alleged police beating - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>NEW: Lawyer says alleged assault was "unprovoked and unnecessary" Hong Kong authorities promise "impartial investigation" into alleged assault video Clip shows protester being carried to dark corner, kicked and punched Pro-democracy protesters have blocked key streets for more than two weeks</highlights>
            <text>Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong authorities have vowed to conduct an impartial investigation into a video which appears to show several plainclothes police officers beating up a detained pro-democracy demonstrator. The widely circulated video shows officers carrying the man to a dark corner, where he's laid on the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched while others stand around, apparently keeping watch. "Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force," said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning. "The Complaints Against Police Office has already received a relevant complaint and will handle it in accordance with the established procedures in a just and impartial manner." Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Lai Tung Kwok told reporters the "officers involved will be temporarily removed from their current duties." He declined to take questions. Embattled Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police. "We will use the same mechanisms and procedures to deal with the complaint against the policemen on the incident last night," he said. Claims of 'brutal violence' The victim has been identified as Ken Tsang, a member of the Civic Party, who's also a social worker and a member of the 1,200 member election committee that chooses Hong Kong's leader. Civic Party leader Alan Leong told CNN: "This is an apparent abuse of police power that a society as civilized as Hong Kong would definitely not swallow. I would advise the commissioner of police to immediately arrest the six officers involved in that attack." Tsang's lawyer Dennis Kwok said, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, "six or seven police officers" led his client to a corner where they punched and kicked him. "It was unprovoked and unnecessary for anyone to use that kind of violence on an arrested person," Kwok said. He said some people had accused Tsang of pouring water on police, but "whatever he was doing he was already arrested, his hands were cuffed and the proper procedure was to take him into custody and deal with him in accordance with the law." Amnesty International called for the prosecution of any officers found to have acted unlawfully. "It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law," said Mabel Au, the group's Hong Kong director. One of protest groups -- Occupy Central With Love and Peace -- circulated photos showing large circular welts on Tsang's back, bruising on his face and scratches on his neck and arms. Another main protest group -- The Hong Kong Federation of Students -- issued a statement calling for the resignation of Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-hung, and other police commanders involved in preventing protesters from re-occupying Lung Wo road on Tuesday night. The road runs past the central government offices, and is near the main Admiralty protest site, the epicenter of the weeks long standoff between protesters and police. Protest clashes Protesters accused police of using pepper spray during the operation, which succeeded in clearing the road for traffic. A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said. Authorities accused them of behaving "in a disorderly manner," throwing traffic cones, snatching police barriers and building road blocks. Four police were injured in the operation, according to a government statement. During the attempted takeover of Lung Wo road, demonstrators declared they were "not afraid of anything." "Ask them if they're afraid of bullets. They're not. This is our last chance. We know we're most likely going to fail, but we have to try," said 62-year-old demonstrator Lo Cheong. Retaking Lung Wo road was necessary "to protect the protesters," said a demonstrator named Bon. In a statement released on Wednesday morning, police appealed to protesters in the area to "stay calm and restrained." "Protestors advancing against Police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act," the statement said. By dawn, morning rush-hour traffic was flowing as normal. The contingent of demonstrators relocated to a park near the government offices, to a green space that they're occupying with tents. Protest disruption Since late September, protesters from a number of pro-democracy groups have been blocking major roads, demanding a greater say in who leads the Special Administrative Region of China. At the peak of the protests, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets, calling for the resignation of leader C.Y. Leung, and demanding the right to be able to nominate candidates for the next election in 2017. Who's who in the protests? Protesters have been guarding barricades erected at protest sites at Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, and for many nights slept in the open air on the asphalt before the arrival of reinforcements with tents over the weekend. Traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures, bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites. Taxi drivers say their takings are down, and businesses claim the protests have cost them income. Hope that the two sides might be able to solve the impasse evaporated on Thursday when the government canceled talks planned with student groups, after protest leaders urged supporters to keep up the occupation. 'Not a revolution' On the weekend, Hong Kong's chief executive told local free-to-air station TVB that the protests were not a "revolution," but a "mass movement that has spun out of control." Who is C.Y. Leung? He said student leaders had "almost zero chance" of pushing Beijing to change its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected. He added he would not submit to the protesters' demands that he resign, because his resignation "will not solve the problem." "It is because the students and other occupation protesters demand more than that. They want the Standing Committee to withdraw its August 31 decision. That is impossible," he said. Beijing white paper He was referring to the white paper issued by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress stating that Hongkongers would be able to vote on their leader in 2017, but only from an approved shortlist of candidates. In response to Leung's comments, the three main groups leading the occupy campaign said it was the government that was out of control -- "a government that fires tear-gas at unarmed citizens and unilaterally terminated dialogue with the students (sic)." On September 28, police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowd after protesters failed to disperse. The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech. The end of police trust? CNN's Pamela Boykoff, Wilfred Chan, Anjali Tsui, Vivian Kam, Elizabeth Joseph, Chieu Luu and Michael Martinez contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Protesters are occupying parts of Hong Kong for a third week Police have cleared some barricades, chipping away at the protest sites Many in Hong Kong oppose the protest China's president has not issued any official statements</highlights>
            <text>Hong Kong (CNN) -- Protesters have occupied major districts in Hong Kong to demand full universal suffrage for the city, a culmination of decades of frustration among the city's democracy activists. But as protests in this city enter a stubborn third week, there hasn't been any real breakthrough. Protesters continue to stake their ground while the Hong Kong police attempt to reopen major thoroughfares around the cities, leading to clashes and arrests. So far there's no sign that the Hong Kong government will resume talks with protest leaders. Here's our guide to understanding the different players, what they want, and why there's no easy solution. The protest leaders Who's calling the shots? The real answer is no one. Last year, law professor Benny Tai came up with the idea to "occupy" Hong Kong's downtown Central district if the government didn't give Hong Kongers full universal suffrage. His Gandhi-inspired group is called "Occupy Central with Love and Peace." But Occupy Central didn't kick off the current protests. Things blew upin late September after three pro-democracy student leaders were arrested at the end of a class boycott, and their supporters tear gassed. That's when tens of thousands of protesters spontaneously came out to occupy Hong Kong's streets, leading to the situation we have now. The most famous student leader is a skinny 17-year-old named Joshua Wong -- he leads a group of high school firebrands called Scholarism, and enjoys popular support among protesters. Also arrested were Alex Chow and Lester Shum from the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS), representing university students. After the Hong Kong government called off talks last week, Chow and Shum are asking protesters to continue occupying the streets so that the government will be forced to respond. The students have one main demand: to bring "real universal suffrage and real democracy" to the city. READ: Meet 17-year-old protest leader Joshua Wong The encampments The occupied sites are fragile but sophisticated self-governed communities. While Tai may have come up with the idea to "occupy" and student leaders incited the protest, citizen protesters have now taken ownership of the movement, which they view as organic and leaderless. The number of protesters at the main camp has dipped from the first week, when the occupation felt like a cross between a summer music festival and a post-apocalyptic settlement. The site sprawls across an eight-lane highway in Hong Kong's Admiralty district, spilling out into side streets fortified by makeshift barricades. A well-oiled volunteer system manages supplies, recycling and first-aid. Each night, exhausted protesters fall asleep on the pavement, clutching their mobile phones. Three miles north, protesters have occupied some of the busiest streets in Mong Kok, a gritty, working-class shopping district famous for its thumping nightlife and triad ties. The atmosphere here is more riotous. On October 3, the encampment was attacked by crowds of older men who tore down tents, attacked students, and allegedly sexually assaulted women in broad daylight. Outraged supporters have rallied to the camp's defense, while police have struggled -- and often failed -- to keep the peace. Protest leaders have tried suggesting that occupiers at Mong Kok leave and join those at Admiralty -- but the Mong Kok campers are stubborn and determined to stay. They hoisted a defiant banner: "If Mong Kok falls, Admiralty is done for." A smaller encampment in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong's shopping district, stretched across two roads until this weekend, when policed moved to reopen one road. Hong Kong's leader C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's chief executive, is hated with a passion by the city's pro-democracy citizens, who view him as an sly, imperious puppet of the Chinese Communist Party. And that's putting it politely. His resignation has been a key demand of protesters since they took to the streets a week ago. Leung has repeatedly said he won't step down. Instead, he has repeatedly asked protesters to disperse, while directing his deputy Carrie Lam to attempt negotiations with student leaders. On Thursday, Lam called off the talks, after student leaders said they would continue occupying streets. But even if talks take place, it's doubtful whether Leung's administration can make any real concessions to protesters. The Hong Kong government's hands are largely tied by Beijing, which has firmly stated it will not allow Hong Kong to have the kind of democracy protesters are calling for. READ: Leung's op-ed for CNN Anti-Occupy Hong Kongers Many Hong Kongers oppose the Occupy protests, and for many different reasons. Some see the protesters as chasing a pipe dream, others say it's a mistake to upset Beijing. Older generations are especially wary of civil unrest, having fled Communist China, lived through Hong Kong's leftist riots in 1967 and witnessed the Tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on their television screens in 1989. What they all share is a deep disdain for the way today's protests are affecting the lives of ordinary citizens. With roads blocked, traffic has been snarled, commutes have been disrupted, and many schools have been forced to close. In Mong Kok, small business owners have reported a dramatic decline in sales. A number of anti-Occupy voices have formed groups. Former journalist Robert Chow calls his group the "Silent Majority for Hong Kong," and says the protesters are "holding Hong Kong hostage." READ: Robert Chow's op-ed for CNN The police The police's goal is to return the city to normal, but they miscalculated by using tear gas on student protesters on September 28. Instead of dispersing the movement, it sparked outrage and hardened protesters' resolve. After scaling back their presence, police are making an effort to reopen major roads surrounding the protest encampments. On October 15, police made dozens of arrests and clashed with protesters who were trying to re-occupy a major road outside the government headquarters. Hong Kong authorities have vowed to investigate a video that appears to show several plainclothes police officers beating and kicking a detained pro-democracy demonstrator hours after the standoff. Here's the dilemma: The police are trying to reopen major roads and eventually clear the protest sites, but attempts to use force have only inflamed tensions. They can't wait too long, either: Police have said some of the protest sites -- especially Mong Kok -- are considered "high risk". READ: Public trust in Hong Kong police erodes Triads At least eight people with triad backgrounds were among 30 arrested in Mong Kok over the weekend after starting fights and igniting anger between Occupy and anti-Occupy protesters. Hong Kong's triads are known for controlling smuggling, prostitution and illegal gambling rings. Some of their businesses in Mong Kok -- Hong Kong's red light district -- have suffered as a result of the Occupy protests. While pro-democracy legislators and protest leaders have accused the government of sending triad members to disperse the protests, it's unclear who may have sent the triads or whether they came on their own accord. Beijing China's president, Xi Jinping, dreads dissent and separatism. As China's economy continues to grow, he has been eager to project an image of national unity and strength to the world. So far, Xi has remained tight-lipped about the protests. Instead, Beijing has expressed its views through the state-run People's Daily newspaper, condemning the protests as "illegal acts" that "are doomed to fail." Beijing also dismissed the movement's potential to spread to the mainland as "no more than a daydream." News articles, social media posts, and images of Hong Kong's protests have been heavily censored in China: as the first images of the occupation went viral, even Instagram became inaccessible. The memory of China's 1989 Tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters has loomed over Hong Kong and Beijing from the start. More than once, protesters have wondered whether Beijing will activate the 6,000 People's Liberation Army troops believed to be stationed in Hong Kong -- but so far, there's been no sign that will happen. It's obvious China is displeased. What's less certain: how serious of a threat they consider the protests to be, and how they might respond.

            <highlights>Texan David Willis wandered into London book store to use free WiFi Willis made phone calls after realizing he was locked in, but no one initially came to his aid He was released after three hours when his social media posts were spotted</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- There's nothing like getting stuck into a good book -- but getting stuck in a good book store is a different matter. Just ask David Willis, a tourist from Texas who was inadvertently locked inside a London retailer for several hours, after strolling in minutes before the store was closing. Willis, from Dallas, entered the Waterstones store near London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening to use the store's WiFi. "I walked into the store about five minutes before 9 p.m.," he told the UK's ITV television network. "I walked in right past employees and I needed to use the internet... I peeked up on the second floor and saw there were chairs and a table up there so I walked up there and was using the internet for 10 or 15 minutes and all the lights were on upstairs. "I get ready to leave and I walk down and it's completely dark and the doors were locked." Willis said despite setting an alarm off by trying to open the doors and speaking to a security guard and police via telephone, no one came to his aid. After several hours of waiting, he took to social media to broadcast his plight, posting on Twitter and Instagram. This is me locked inside a waterstones bookstore in London. I was upstairs for 15 minutes and came... http://t.co/EefA1antuG Hi @Waterstones I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for 2 hours now. Please let me out. That did the trick. As his messages were retweeted thousands of times, a Waterstones employee spotted them and secured his release. The bookstore posted its own Twitter message shortly afterward, announcing: "We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets!" We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets! After three hours in captivity, Willis followed that with his own Twitter declaration: "I'm free". Speaking the morning after his ordeal, Willis told ITV: "I'm very tired, I did not sleep very much last night but it feels good to be free."

            <highlights>Milan director Umberto Gandini tells CNN the time was right for Mario Balotelli to leave Gandini says the controversial striker is not yet at the stage where he can "carry the club" Balotelli left Milan for Liverpool in August but has had a modest start to life at Anfield The 24-year-old has just one goals in eight matches and was recently benched</highlights>
            <text>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook (CNN) -- One goal in eight matches for new club Liverpool, and dumped by the Italian national team. Perhaps the man known as "Super" Mario Balotelli isn't feeling quite so super at present. Offloaded by Italian giants AC Milan prior to the start of the season, the 24-year-old is already onto the fourth high-profile club of his fledgling career. And until the striker, painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press, proves he can '"carry" a club, his enormous potential may go unfulfilled, according to Milan director Umberto Gandini. Read: Balotelli signs for Liverpool "Probably Mario has not made the transition yet from being just a fantastic athlete to a great player," Gandini told CNN of one of the most talked about players in world football. "The expectation was probably bigger (at AC Milan), and I think also his expectations, and he has not reached the status yet where he can carry the club. "Until he will do that he won't be able to fulfill his promises." Balotelli has struggled to adapt to life back in the English Premier League, scoring just one goal in eight matches for Liverpool since his $25 million move in August. Even his new manager Brendan Rodgers admitted signing the former Inter forward was a "calculated risk" given his checkered past, saying the player himself knows this is probably his last chance. Not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on Merseyside -- Luis Suarez, now at Spanish club Barcelona. The Uruguayan achieved cult status at the club, scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances, and 31 times last season as the Reds came agonizingly close to a first Premier League title since 1990. And while there are similarities in the way the pair have courted controversy in the past, Balotelli is yet to offered any hint of the potency that punctuated Suarez's stay at the club. He is yet to get off the mark in the Premier League and whether he will play alongside Daniel Sturridge on Sunday against QPR, the England striker having returned to fitness, remains to be seen. Tales of Balotelli's private life dominated his last stint in England and Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, this week said the striker was signed against his advice, calling him a "bad apple." But that is at odds with Gandini's assessment -- that Balotelli is far more professional than he is portrayed -- though he does acknowledge the player is energized by conflict. "He is much, much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in England," Gandini added. "He is a fantastic kid, he is humble, and recognizes a lot of values that football has given to him, and life in general. "I think he loves the fight. He loves to fight with something or somebody -- on the pitch, in life. He's always trying to take the stance. Good morning Liverpool! Good morning everybody! Today is a new day! We dont care about the past! We work for the future✌🙏👹 "The more you go after him and provoke him, the more he feels energy and wants to go after it. That may be something he has to learn to control." One Italian newspaper claimed Balotelli made 788 headlines in his 568 days in Milan while another said the striker possessed "the strange talent of making everyone happy when he arrives and even happier when he leaves." But Gandini insisted he left Milan on good terms, even though it was clear he had become surplus to requirements at the Rossoneri. "We honestly thought the best for him was to come to Milan and work in an environment in which he was supported very strongly," he explained. "He likes Milan, he loves the team, but then we got to a point when we were looking for a different kind of player and he was looking for a different challenge. "Liverpool was there for him. I think that Mario like all the other top players wants to play in the Premier League. He had his first taste with City, now he is more mature and has the opportunity with Liverpool, an historic club. "That's the environment where he should succeed, and then obviously, at the end of the day it is down to him. I hope he does fulfill his potential, for him, for Liverpool and for the national team." Milan, a seven-time champion of Europe, is now reduced to talking about potential themselves. For a club so used to silverware (18 Italian league tiles and counting) going two seasons without any constitutes something of a crisis, but failing to qualify for this season's Champions League is bordering on disaster. During the summer transfer window, Milan bought former Liverpool striker Fernando Torres from Chelsea and Gandini admits it is vital the club retakes its place among Europe's elite without delay. "The cost of not being in the Champions League is very heavy, frankly speaking," he said. "For an Italian club in the Champions League today we can talk about guaranteed money of €35-40m ($44-$50m) and if you have a turnover of €220m ($278m) it's a big share of it. "Luckily enough, we had provisions of variables into the salaries of the players, some of them can be amortized over time but on the other hand it is critical for us to go back to the Champions League, ideally this season," added Gandini, referring to an accounting tool used by football clubs "We cannot deny the fact we didn't qualify for Europe has been a turning point in a certain way. We had to regroup and try to improve the value of the squad and try to regain our position among the top clubs in Europe. "It's very, very important even if it not going to be easy." One thing that has been back at the club after an enforced absence is the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, whose daughter Barbara is AC's vice-president and managing director. The politician and businessman, who spent nine years as Italian prime minster, bought the club in 1986, kick-starting a golden period in the club's history. Berlusconi, who has been dogged by scandal in recent years, is fully supportive of new manager Filippo Inzaghi, and is now "very close to the club," according to Gandini. "I think he went to visit the club six weeks in a row which he has not done probably since he went into politics in 1994," Gandini explained. "He didn't have so many opportunities to go weekly to see the club training, to talk to the players, to see the way the work is developing, which is very good. "From a personal point of view he is dedicating much more time personally to be with the club and with the teams and the players especially which he hasn't done for 20 years now. "It's very good - he brings a lot of enthusiasm. He has his own vision obviously, been one of most successful entrepreneurs we have in Italy, a great football president. "He always says that he competes with Santiago Bernabéu de Yeste (former president of Spanish club Real Madrid) as the winningest president in football. "AC Milan under Mr Berlusconi's ownership has been outstanding, I think." Inzaghi has a big job on his hands, to sate the appetite for winning of the club's demanding fans, and to satisfy the hierarchy, who can be quick on the trigger when it comes to under performing managers. But for now the former Milan legend, who spent over a decade at the San Siro and won two European Champions League titles, has the backing of Berlusconi as he tries to rebuild the club. It faces Verona on Sunday. "It is very important he has the club backing him, Mr Berlusconi, and the results are on his side so far," Gandini said. "We made mistakes in the past, rushing into decisions that Milan was not used to doing, and I think we learned from the mistakes we made."

            <title>Bob Geldof: Ebola threatening state collapse - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T12:25:10Z</date>
            <author>Susannah Cullinane, CNN</author>
            <highlights>An outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 4,400 people since March Campaigner and musician Bob Geldof says immediate action is needed to stop the crisis Geldof says Ebola's spread is linked to poverty in the worst affected countries He warns affected states could collapse, allowing Ebola and "human evils" to take hold</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Containing the Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa is plausible -- but action needs to be taken immediately, before affected states potentially collapse and the virus spirals out of control, campaigner Bob Geldof says. "Even out of self-interest you have to act in these instances," Geldof told CNN's Max Foster. "There is no time-lag between what happens in the poor parts of the world and it affecting us, which is why we have to ... intervene quite radically and effectively and immediately." Since the outbreak started in March, about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO has warned there could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week across the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year. Geldof, the musician responsible for coordinating Live Aid concerts to draw attention to famine in Africa in the 1980s, said people starved then because they couldn't grow food and they and their governments had no money to buy any. "In effect they died of poverty. "The same is happening now in West Africa. They don't have the doctors, nurses, hospitals, state systems that they have in Texas or Madrid and so once again, through no fault of their own, this virus is out of control in states where there are no systems -- because there is no money," he said. In Sierra Leone, one of the nations worst-hit by Ebola, the situation was "particularly tragic," he said. "Sierra Leone was just getting off its knees, beginning to breathe, the economy was beginning to have traction and people were beginning to get well educated, hospitals were being built," Geldof said. "You could be looking at -- some people think -- some sort of state collapse, which would be utterly unthinkable because the disease itself, should that happen, would then spiral away by itself." But Geldof was hopeful the spread of the virus could be halted. "With the right will, the right level of commitment, this can be contained. The issue is, will it be contained in time to stop these states collapsing and then other evils -- human evils -- emanating from that," he said. "I've been briefed on what the response is and should all of it happen then I think it's plausible. But it has to happen immediately, it has to happen now. It's now beyond getting together and having a summit. It's now calling up the various leaders and saying 'now, do it now, mobilize this thing instantly and proactively." The medical organization Medicines San Frontieres -- or Doctors Without Borders -- had warned six months ago of the Ebola threat to the world and "we should have put a stop to it then," he said. An effective response, however, depended on more than "just the usual suspects" of Western Europe and the United States getting involved, said Geldof. "It should be in the interest to the Chinese and the Japanese and the Russians to contribute to this and we hear very little from them and we should hear more."

            <highlights>Savelli smartphones come complete with 18-carat white gold casing CNN's Nina dos Santos sat down with Savelli's CEO to talk about their new limited collection Encrusted with precious diamonds, these phones come with a price tag of $250,000</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: Nina dos Santos is a news anchor and correspondent based in London. She is the host of CNN International's London-based business show, The Business View. Follow her on Twitter. (CNN) -- Smartphones just got smarter - or at least more expensive. With a price tag of $250,000, Savelli smartphones come complete with 18-carat white gold casing encrusted with precious diamonds. It's as much a piece of jewelery as a gadget. The mission of its makers, the Geneva-based jeweler Savelli, was to "elevate a phone into haute couture." "It's the most important object one has with them all the time -- it's in your hand, it's in your pocket, it's next to you when you sleep, you can touch it 100 times a day," Alessandro Savelli, the firm's CEO, told CNN's Nina dos Santos. The jeweler is hoping to win the hearts of luxury shoppers, with the brand focusing exclusively on women. "I think our customers are really looking for something special, really a beautiful object which they use every day and is extremely visible and really makes part of their persona," Savelli said. The limited collection features 11 smartphones powered by Google Android system and decorated with luxury materials, such as sapphires and emeralds, and finished off with ostrich, python and iguana leather. The two most expensive models are limited to only 27 pieces. The hand-made Emerald Night, is embellished with 18-carat rose gold and 400 brilliant-cut emeralds, while Emerald Insane features 75 baguette-cut emeralds on white gold. The same techniques and materials used in jewelry manufacture are used to produce the phones, Savelli said. "We don't really see the mobile phone industry as a competitor," Savelli said. "We see more the watch and jewelery as our universe." After launching in Europe, the brand is now looking towards the east and emerging markets, such as China, Middle East and Russia, where the luxury business is booming.

            <highlights>A British man charged with planning an attack said he had been to Syria, court hears Defendant Erol Incedal had documents on how to build a bomb, prosecution says Incedal denies two charges; a second defendant has admitted to one charge Police say Incedal had the address of a property belonging to former UK PM Tony Blair</highlights>
            <text>London (CNN) -- A British man charged with planning either a "Mumbai-style" terror attack or an attack on a prominent person said in secret recordings that he had been to Syria and reveled in the idea of being labeled a terrorist, a court in London heard Thursday. Erol Incedal, 26, is accused of preparing terrorist acts with the intention of committing terrorism, and of having documents on how to build a bomb. He denies the charges against him. Police first detained Incedal, a British citizen of Turkish descent, over a traffic violation in London in September 2013. During a search of his car, they found a piece of paper with the address of a property tied to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair written on it. Police planted a secret listening device in Incedal's E-Class Mercedes before releasing him. The recordings have been revealed this week at Incedal's trial, which will be partially held in secret. While the judge has allowed some reporting of its opening phases, journalists and members of the public will be barred from observing other parts of the trial. The prosecution says the recordings from inside Incedal's car give "a flavor" of the law student's frame of mind in the weeks before he was arrested again in October of last year and formally charged. In one clip, Incedal and his associate Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar claim to have been in Syria. "In Syria, the weather was ...," Rarmoul-Bouhadjar says, before Incedal interjects with, "Wallahi, it was like minus-20 degrees because we were on a mountain!" "Another word, 'terrorist.' That's a great word, Mounir. There's never been a greater word than that to describe us," Incedal tells Rarmoul-Bouhadjar in another clip. The jury also heard recordings of Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar purportedly using code words in a discussion about buying a gun. Incedal told his partner: "Update me at every stage and just say 'yeah the sausage is nice, there's enough sauce in it.' " "What's the sausage?" Rarmoul-Bouhadjar asks. Incedal replies: "Bullets. If there's not enough sauce in it, you'll have to make that decision if we're gonna take it or not. If it's less than five, it's not worth it." In another clip, the pair appear to be discussing the quality of their potential purchase. "It is only about a grand, so I don't think it is going to be a great quality," says Incedal. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar asks, "It fires?" Incedal replies: "Mmm ... it's not a replica." In another recording, Rarmoul-Bouhadjar appears to suggest to Incedal that he should leave his wife. "I think you should separate," he tells Incedal. "She has mentally become unstable." "Do you know what I'm worried about now? She knows some of our secrets," Incedal replies. "She don't know much but she knows I was, like, in trouble. ... I'm not saying it's going to happen, but she might just chat s**t." Police finally decided to swoop in on October 13, 2013. Specialist firearms officers stopped the pair in east London and shot out the tires of Incedal's car to prevent an escape. They arrested both men and seized several iPhones and other mobile phones from the car, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say Incedal's iPhone had a number of images on it, including an image of a YouTube page for a song called "O Islamic State" and an image of a page of titles by Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who was killed by an American drone strike in late September 2011 in Yemen. Both men's iPhones concealed an SD card between the phone and the phone's protective case. Both SD cards contained three identical files, including a "Car Bomb Recognition Guide" and a "bomb making" Word document, parts of which were considered "viable" but also incomplete, the court heard. Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype, using code words and aliases to refer to the words "Kalashnikov" and "Mumbai-style," the prosecution said. More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar has already pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a document that could be used in a terror attack. Officers searching Incedal's south London home also found a document on top of a wardrobe referring to a "Plan A" that appeared to be a checklist for an operation involving "three to four workers," "two tennis rackets," "one months' surveillance," and renting a flat nearby, Prosecutor Richard Whittam said. Incedal's wife, Kadeejah Baluch, was home at the time with Incedal's three children and another child. Police also searched a second address in west London that Incedal had failed to disclose to police at the time of his arrest. That search turned up a laptop with Incedal's DNA all over it and several Nicolas Cage DVDs, among other things, the court heard. It is unclear when the alleged terror plots were to be carried out. But during an argument with his wife that was captured by the police listening device inside his car, Incedal says: "I'm never going to be around for very long anyway ... at least my last few months of life, I'll live with peace of mind." The trial continues at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy with a low unemployment rate The 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall highlights economic success Collapse of East and West has meant massive growth for Germany in various industries</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: To mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, CNN's special program Fall of the Wall will look at how Germany's economy has developed since the momentous event. (CNN) -- Not so long ago, Germany was vilified for its slow economic growth, high unemployment rates, and record budget deficits. As late as 2004, The Economist called it the Sick Man of Europe. Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union. Its 5.3% unemployment rate is the second lowest in the EU. Germany exports more merchandise than any other country aside from China, and its share of total world trade is larger than that of the U.S. Not bad for a nation of 81 million citizens that's not even amongst the world's 15 most populated worldwide. The roots of Germany's 21st century economic success date back to the Industrial Revolution, when Germans were early adopters of rail transportation and coal production. But the country's current rise to status of economic superstar began on a cold autumn day, exactly 25 years ago. Fall of the wall On November 9, 1989, a group of excited Berliners used mauls, chisels, hammers and fists to smash down the wall that divided the West and East part of the city. The fall of the Berlin Wall was an iconic moment, which intensified a process that fully materialized two years later with the collapse of the Soviet Union. What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty. They also found a highly skilled workforce that was comparatively cheap, and new markets with an appetite for products. They found opportunities -- not only in the eastern part of their reunified nation, but also in many other former Soviet-bloc countries, like Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. "Part of the success story of the German multinationals was their capacity to use the opportunities that arose -- first with reunification, and secondly with the expansion of the EU," said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank. "German companies became increasingly skilled at understanding foreign markets and leaning towards foreign markets. Germany has done that in a way which I'd say is more efficient than what you see in the United Kingdom or France, which are the other two big economies that traditionally have had an outward-oriented vision." Ahead of the times By the end of the 1990's, businesses from Germany played key roles in countries transitioning to market economy, according to Erixon. German manufacturers were outsourcing parts of their supply chain to Eastern Europe, and German financial firms provided services to millions of people who were just discovering capitalism. It didn't end on the eastern edge of Europe. Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin. "You have these two huge blocks, huge economies that were starving for investment goods and it just so happens that is where Germany had its comparative advantage -- in the production of investment goods," Collier said. "The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods." The goods Collier referred to are mainly vehicles, machinery, pharmaceuticals and electronics. German car manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen established a particularly strong presence in the Chinese market. Companies like Siemens, BASF (chemicals), Deutsche Bank (one Europe's largest banks), and Allianz (insurance) also became leading global corporations. Promoting skills In addition, thousands of medium-sized companies, often family owned, have been successful internationally and particularly in Asia, according to Anke Hassel, professor of public policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Hassel said one of the keys to Germany's manufacturing success is the country's unique apprenticeship scheme, in which school leavers spend two to three years training with companies. "The apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way," said Hassel. "They give them industry and firm-specific skills." Hassel explained that having relatively highly-skilled workers allows companies to be more flexible with their production process, and continuously improve. But it's not all rosy. According to Hassel, Germany's dependence on exports make it very vulnerable. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy. And fluctuations will always happen. Currently, as market demand in China and other emerging markets is slowing down, Germany's challenge is to rebalance its economy away from an enormously heavy dependence on exports. It needs to increase domestic consumption, which has been relatively weak for decades, otherwise the economic growth it has experienced will not be sustained. In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become a superpower. But as Germans know better than anyone, economic realities can change very quickly.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>At online-shopping warehouse, 200 robots help workers dispatch retail orders The robots, made by Amazon subsidiary Kiva, have a reported accuracy rate of 99.99% They have their own names and can even find their charging station</highlights>
            <text>The Art of Movement is a monthly show that highlights the most significant innovations in science and technology that are helping shape our modern world. (CNN) -- In a warehouse about the size of four football fields, more than a million units of online retail items are housed. It is essential that all inventory is organized and easy to find, in order to get these items to their final destinations on time -- that is, unless the inventory needed can be summoned on demand. That is exactly what happens at the 25,500-square-meter Quiet Logistics fulfillment center, in Massachusetts, where 200 robots help workers prepare 10,000 to 20,000 orders for delivery every day. It uses a system designed by Amazon subsidiary Kiva that keeps track of all inventory so the robots know exactly what is on each storage unit. "The robots job is really to move inventory from storage to the work station," said Brian Lemerise VP of third-party fulfillment at Quiet Logistics. "Anytime someone places an order ... the robot is dispatched to the storage location that has that unit and brings it to our associates to pick." Read: Filming nature's fluorescent light show beneath the waves Kiva robots have a reported accuracy rate of 99.99%, so human error is practically eliminated in this phase of the process. With names like Bot-Mobile, Jack-in-the-Bot, and Betty-Bot, each robot is given its own identity and its own assignments. Like a choreographed routine they move autonomously up and down the aisles of the warehouse at about 10 kilometers per hour -- never missing a step, and always hitting their mark. This is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units, which together communicate where the bot is driving to. They are designed to operate in tight quarters and at just 76 cm long, 64cm wide and 41 cm high, the robots are small enough to travel under the storage units, yet strong enough to lift almost a metric ton of merchandise. They can even find the charging station when their power is running low. What keeps this mechanical workforce performing with such precision -- and from crashing into each other -- is the software that commands it. "We think of the software as being a giant air traffic control system," says Al Dekin, Senior VP of sales and marketing at Quiet Logistics. "The software will allocate a certain number of spots to a specific robot; that's what keeps the robots from hitting each other" He adds: "In terms of overall productivity, the use of the robotics tend to be around anywhere between three-and-a-half to upwards of five times more productive, so we'd have to have that many more people to actually get the same amount of work done." But the human touch is still necessary to get the products out the door. Quiet Logistics has 400 people working on fulfillment at the Massachusetts facility alone, so these smart machines are not yet ready to replace living workers. But they do make it easier to get the job done. Read: Filming nature's fluorescent light show beneath the waves Read: Does 'immortal' jellyfish have the secret to everlasting life?

            <text>London (CNN) -- Five men picked up in a series of recent terror-related arrests have now been charged, London's Metropolitan Police said Friday. Four of the men, who range in age from 20 to 24, were charged under the Terrorism Act and are accused of taking an oath of allegience to ISIS, according to a statement from police. The extremist group operating in Iraq and Syria has urged lone followers in the West to stage terror attacks in their home countries. The fifth man arrested was charged with a firearms offense, according to police. Three other men arrested in the same series of raids over the last 10 days have been released. A woman who was arrested was released on bail until next week, police said. Authorities arrested the suspects after searching residences and vehicles in west and central London. At the time of the arrests, authorities said they may have foiled an early-stage terror plot with the arrests. CNN's Richard Greene contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>Albanian prime minister's brother 'disgusted' by drone allegations - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-15T12:17:20Z</date>
            <highlights>Prime minister of Albania's brother hits back at allegations Serbian official told CNN that drone was controlled by Olsi Rama Serbia vs. Albania game abandoned after 41 minutes Flag flown over stadium by drone sparked chaos</highlights>
            <text>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook (CNN) -- It's a plot twist that even a thriller writer might have struggled to come up with during Serbia's European qualifying clash with Albania in Belgrade. A drone flying a flag depicting the "Greater Albania" over a major international soccer game Tuesday was the subject of a 'whodunnit' mystery after the brother of the Albanian prime minister hit back at allegations by a Serbian government official that he had been piloting the quadcopter. "I am very disgusted by the allegation of my having any involvement in the piloting of the drone," Olsi Rama told CNN Wednesday, who said he had been taking pictures of the game from a VIP suite at the stadium. As a football match mushroomed into a diplomatic incident amid claim and counter-claim in a region of a world that is still riven by ethnic divisions, his version of events conflicted with Serbia's version of events. "According to the information from the police he (Olsi Rama) was in possession of the navigator," said a Serbian official as the country's football federation labeled the drone flight a "terrorist action planned in advance." UEFA has confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against both teams. The game was abandoned after 41 minutes with players clashing after the flag was taken down by a Serbian player. Rama insisted the police's actions were part of a Serbian "plot," after discovering he was the Albanian prime minister's brother. "There were 50 or so Albanian guys who can say I didn't have the controller-- they searched everyone." The Serbian prime minister's office also stated that Rama was arrested and sent home to Albania, a claim denied by the Albanian government's spokesman. "There is no proof whatsoever and Olsi Rama was never arrested in Belgrade," Endri Fuga, communications director for the prime minister of Albania told CNN. "He has nothing to do with the drone." The contest, played at Partizan's stadium in Belgrade, was abandoned near the end of the first half following ugly scenes involving fans and players. "When you have 32,000 people shouting kill, kill, kill Albanians, it's living in another dimension," said Rama. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. "What happened last night in Belgrade is truly sad," Fuga told CNN. "The Albanian government firmly condemns the despicable expressions of racism and violence against the Albanian National team players. "We put all of our trust in UEFA to conduct a fair investigation which sheds light on the truth of all that happened in the Belgrade Stadium, from the start of our national anthem to the very last moment that our squad left the stadium," added Fuga referring to European football's governing body. "Football should never be mixed with politics and state politics cannot be driven by what happens in a football match." Fuga believes the scenes witnessed in the Serbian capital offer "further proof that the ghosts of the past" that still haunt the Balkans. "The false story that the Albanian prime minister's brother instigated the showdown of violence by launching a drone carrying a flag over the stadium, is a testament to the presence of harmful elements that wish to keep this region mired in the past," said Fuga, who explained Rama was one of a few dozen Albanians who attended the game with valid tickets provided by the country's football association. He says that the group were searched by police but not found to be carrying anything. "The Albanian Prime Minister remains firmly committed to fostering this new, historical chapter of peace and cooperation," said Fuga. "He will do all in his power to ensure it will not be closed by hatreds such as those which cast such a negative shadow on the football game." Rama says that he was moved from the VIP box for security reasons and informed the authorities that he held American citizenship before being given a police escort to waiting buses. "I tried with my broken Serbian to understand what was happening, but they said this is orders," he added. "I had no involvement in the drone. When the banner came up we had no idea, we thought some Serbians set it up." Prime Minister Rama is scheduled to arrive in Belgrade in the next few days -- the first such visit by an Albanian leader in 68 years. In a statement on its website, UEFA said that the match "was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body." UEFA spokesperson Pedro Pinto told CNN an announcement on sanctions against both countries are expected to be made within a week. Albania's first visit to Belgrade since 1967 was expected to be a tense occasion, though the events of Tuesday evening appeared to catch security authorities by surprise. The "Greater Albania" insignia, which was attached to the drone, refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic Albanians reside -- one which would include Kosovo. The two illustrated figures on the flag were Isa Boletini, an Albanian nationalist who led uprisings against the Serbs and Ottomans in 1912 and 1913, while the other, Ismail Qemali, is considered to be the founder of the modern Albanian state, which became independent in 1912. The word "Autochthonous," which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place, was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to Serbians. When Serbian player Stefan Mitrovic ripped the flag down, it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. Martin Atkinson, the English referee, took the players off the field with the game goalless. "What happened is something we can't comprehend at the moment," Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic told reporters following the abandonment. "On behalf of my team, all I can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the Albanian players every step of the way to the tunnel (after the riot broke out). "The Albanian team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match. "We can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now." Security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in Belgrade with away fans prevented from attending amidst heightening tensions over Kosovo -- a majority-Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008. In 1999, a 78-day air war was launched by NATO to stop the killing off ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France -- but not Serbia. Four of Albania's starting lineup were born in Kosovo, with Lorik Cana of Italian club Lazio, goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, midfielder Burim Kukeli and Ermir Lenjani. With Kosovo not recognized as a state by the United Nations, it is unable to join FIFA or UEFA, meaning some of its players have adopted other countries. Xherdan Shaqiri, who plays his club football with Bayern Munich, represents Switzerland as does Valon Behrami and Granit Xhaka. While Kosovo is able to play friendly matches, the team cannot compete in international competition. Belgium-born Adnan Januzaj, one of the most exciting talents in the English Premier League with Manchester United, turned down the opportunity to play for Kosovo, where his father is from. He was also eligible for Albania through his mother's lineage. "We came to Belgrade to play football, but we were physically attacked by the Serbian supporters," Cana told reporters on Tuesday. "We just wanted to take the flag, and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players. "I was defending my teammate, I have injuries to my face, as does Taulant Xhaka. They asked us to play in front of empty stands (instead of abandonment) -- however, we did not feel good because of our injuries." The two countries must now wait for UEFA to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed. and what punishments are handed out. "It is a regretful situation on which we will report; the referee, myself and the security adviser. The circumstances were such that we couldn't continue the match," UEFA's match delegate, Harry Been told reporters. "You all saw what happened and I cannot comment on who is to blame or what to blame. I will submit a report with my colleagues to UEFA and UEFA will decide what will happen further."

            <text>Editor's note: To mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, CNN's special program Fall of the Wall will look at how Germany's economy has developed since the momentous event. (CNN) -- Not so long ago, Germany was vilified for its slow economic growth, high unemployment rates, and record budget deficits. As late as 2004, The Economist called it the Sick Man of Europe. Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union. Its 5.3% unemployment rate is the second lowest in the EU. Germany exports more merchandise than any other country aside from China, and its share of total world trade is larger than that of the U.S. Not bad for a nation of 81 million citizens that's not even amongst the world's 15 most populated worldwide. The roots of Germany's 21st century economic success date back to the Industrial Revolution, when Germans were early adopters of rail transportation and coal production. But the country's current rise to status of economic superstar began on a cold autumn day, exactly 25 years ago. Fall of the wall On November 9, 1989, a group of excited Berliners used mauls, chisels, hammers and fists to smash down the wall that divided the West and East part of the city. The fall of the Berlin Wall was an iconic moment, which intensified a process that fully materialized two years later with the collapse of the Soviet Union. What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty. They also found a highly skilled workforce that was comparatively cheap, and new markets with an appetite for products. They found opportunities -- not only in the eastern part of their reunified nation, but also in many other former Soviet-bloc countries, like Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. "Part of the success story of the German multinationals was their capacity to use the opportunities that arose -- first with reunification, and secondly with the expansion of the EU," said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank. "German companies became increasingly skilled at understanding foreign markets and leaning towards foreign markets. Germany has done that in a way which I'd say is more efficient than what you see in the United Kingdom or France, which are the other two big economies that traditionally have had an outward-oriented vision." Ahead of the times By the end of the 1990's, businesses from Germany played key roles in countries transitioning to market economy, according to Erixon. German manufacturers were outsourcing parts of their supply chain to Eastern Europe, and German financial firms provided services to millions of people who were just discovering capitalism. It didn't end on the eastern edge of Europe. Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin. "You have these two huge blocks, huge economies that were starving for investment goods and it just so happens that is where Germany had its comparative advantage -- in the production of investment goods," Collier said. "The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods." The goods Collier referred to are mainly vehicles, machinery, pharmaceuticals and electronics. German car manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen established a particularly strong presence in the Chinese market. Companies like Siemens, BASF (chemicals), Deutsche Bank (one Europe's largest banks), and Allianz (insurance) also became leading global corporations. Promoting skills In addition, thousands of medium-sized companies, often family owned, have been successful internationally and particularly in Asia, according to Anke Hassel, professor of public policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Hassel said one of the keys to Germany's manufacturing success is the country's unique apprenticeship scheme, in which school leavers spend two to three years training with companies. "The apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way," said Hassel. "They give them industry and firm-specific skills." Hassel explained that having relatively highly-skilled workers allows companies to be more flexible with their production process, and continuously improve. But it's not all rosy. According to Hassel, Germany's dependence on exports make it very vulnerable. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy. And fluctuations will always happen. Currently, as market demand in China and other emerging markets is slowing down, Germany's challenge is to rebalance its economy away from an enormously heavy dependence on exports. It needs to increase domestic consumption, which has been relatively weak for decades, otherwise the economic growth it has experienced will not be sustained. In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become a superpower. But as Germans know better than anyone, economic realities can change very quickly.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <text>Editor's note: To mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, CNN's special program Fall of the Wall will look at how Germany's economy has developed since the momentous event. (CNN) -- If the past 25 years are anything to go by, Germany has proven its firm position as the world's economic powerhouse. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the county thrust forward, developing a world-class car manufacturing industry and a network of small-to-medium size businesses which represent the backbone of the country's economy.

            <highlights>Spanish nurse's assistant Teresa Romero Ramos speaks to her husband by phone Romero says she'd treat Ebola patients again if cured, a family spokeswoman says She is doing better and has been able to drink some water; doctors are hopeful Spain is considering a U.S. request to use Spanish bases in mission to fight Ebola</highlights>
            <text>Madrid (CNN) -- The Spanish nurse's assistant who contracted Ebola after treating a patient with the deadly virus is feeling a little better and says she would treat Ebola patients again if she is cured, a family friend and spokeswoman said Wednesday. Teresa Romero Ramos is being treated at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. She spoke to her husband, Javier Limon, by phone for 10 minutes, family spokeswoman Teresa Mesa told journalists outside the hospital Wednesday. She said Romero was stable and doing better, though hospital officials said Tuesday she remains in serious condition. Romero has been drinking water since Tuesday night, and doctors are hopeful about her condition, Mesa said. She's not yet been able to eat anything. It was in her conversation with her husband that Romero said she would pick up where she left off in caring for Ebola patients, Mesa said. "Javier told me she is such a fool that when she gets out of here, she will do it again," Mesa said "He said, 'Honey, are you going to do it again?' And she said, 'Do what?' And he says, 'Well, that. Risk your life.' And she says, 'Yeah, but now I have the antivirus, now it's OK.' That was the response of Teresa." For Ebola caregivers, enormous fear, risk and bravery Romero doesn't know about dog's death Romero asked Limon about her dog but does not yet know that it was put down by officials concerned that it might carry the Ebola virus, Mesa said. Hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition to try to stop authorities from euthanizing the dog, while dozens of protesters demonstrated outside the couple's home. Limon, who has been kept under observation in a hospital as a high-risk contact, has criticized authorities' handling of the Ebola crisis. In a scathing letter released Monday, he said his wife had received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister. A special committee set up by the government to handle the outbreak said Wednesday that all 15 people under observation in hospital remained asymptomatic. Meanwhile, the Spanish government continues to deal with the fallout of Romero becoming the first person to contract Ebola in the current outbreak outside Africa. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faced a grilling in Parliament on Wednesday from opposition lawmakers over the government's response so far. A hospital source told journalists Wednesday that one floor of the facility is being remodeled to better prepare it for handling Ebola cases. How did Spanish nurse catch Ebola? Spanish bases As international efforts to combat Ebola grow larger, the United States is seeking permission to use two of Spain's bases as a transit point for flights to Africa carrying military personnel and supplies. Spain has agreed that some U.S. flights heading to Africa can use its Rota naval and Moron air bases -- but has not yet approved their use by flights returning from Africa, a Spanish Defense Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. The United States already has troops stationed at those bases. Spanish Defense Minister Pedro Morenes is due to meet U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in Washington on Friday. U.S. Ambassador to Madrid James Costos told Spain's Antena 3 TV station that the United States was not planning for U.S. military personnel to provide direct patient care or for U.S. military aircraft to transport symptomatic patients. He said the U.S. request was being considered on case-by-case basis. The U.S. Embassy has said a small number of such transit flights have already been approved. Washington is hoping Spain will approve the wider request. The U.S. Embassy has said Rota and Moron are two among other bases the United States would use in various countries, as the military tries to keep different options available for the transit of personnel and supplies in the Ebola fight. There are more than 500 U.S. troops in the region currently, and the Pentagon has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 to assist in fighting the virus. Troops are not expected to treat Ebola patients, but there is an acknowledgment by the Pentagon that some could be at risk of coming into contact with the virus.

            <title>WHO: Ebola cases may soar; CDC: Team to help hospitals - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-14T08:34:09Z</date>

            <highlights>New site manager at Texas hospital is a "critical role," CDC director says WHO predicts 5,000-10,000 Ebola cases a week in worst-hit countries by December CDC director: A new team will help hospitals around the United States deal with Ebola Dallas nurse: "I'm doing well"; she thanks "everyone for their kind wishes and prayers"</highlights>
            <text>Madrid (CNN) -- It's an ominous number. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday. And now that a nurse has become the first person to contract Ebola on American soil, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has a new plan to help hospitals handle the deadly virus. "For any hospital anywhere in the country that has a confirmed case of Ebola, we will put a team on the ground within hours," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. The response team will include experts in infection control, protective equipment and experimental therapies. A team such as that, Frieden said, might have prevented a Dallas nurse from contracting the disease. The nurse was a member of the medical team that treated an Ebola patient who died last week. "I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the first patient was diagnosed. That might have prevented this infection," Frieden said. "But we will do that from this day onward with any case anywhere in the U.S." In addition to the many experts it sent to Dallas, Frieden said, the CDC "could have sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more hands-on with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed. "Ebola is unfamiliar. It's scary," said Frieden. "And getting it right is really, really important, because the stakes are so high." Speaking to reporters in Switzerland, WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Bruce Aylward told reporters that the Ebola outbreak could get worse before it gets better. By December, he said, there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases weekly in West Africa. Compare those December projections to the latest figures. As of Tuesday morning, there were a total of 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths reported to the WHO, Aylward said. The outbreak's mortality rate, he said, is about 70%. "This has been a deadly disease ever since we discovered it in 1976," said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a staff writer at the Dallas Morning News and a former CDC disease detective. "Certainly the death rate can be lowered if we don't have any delays in diagnosis and don't have any delays in treating people," Yasmin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Aylward told reporters that in 90 days, officials have a goal they're aiming for: They want to see the number of cases dropping from week to week. To start to decrease the rate of infection, the WHO says it hopes to isolate 70% of Ebola patients and have 70% of Ebola victim burials performed safely by December 1. Getting responders, facilities and plans in place to meet the goal will be very difficult, Aylward said. Missing the goal will mean that more people will die than should have and that even more resources will be needed because the infection rate will continue to climb, he said. Dallas nurse speaks Days after authorities announced that a Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola, concerns in the United States have focused on a key question: Are people who are putting themselves in harm's way to care for Ebola victims receiving the training and equipment they need? "I've been hearing loud and clear from health care workers from around the country that they're worried, that they don't feel prepared to take care of a patient with Ebola," Frieden said. Every hospital in the United States needs to be prepared to handle Ebola, he said, adding that the CDC will be stepping up training efforts. The Dallas nurse, Nina Pham, had cared for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died of the illness at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. "A single infection in a health care worker is unacceptable," Frieden said. "And what we're doing at this point is looking at everything we can do to minimize that risk so those that are caring for her do that safely and effectively." At least 76 health care workers who may have come into contact with Duncan after he was hospitalized are now being monitored for symptoms of the disease, Frieden said. At the Dallas hospital, teams from the CDC are taking a number of steps to improve safety in handling Ebola, Frieden said, including ensuring there's a site manager making sure protective equipment is put on and taken off correctly. "There wasn't a single individual accountable for that," he said. "That's a critical role and that's there now." They're also improving training at the hospital and limiting the number of staff who go into the isolation area, he said. In a statement Tuesday, Pham thanked supporters for sending kind wishes and prayers, according to the Dallas hospital where she is being treated. "I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world," she said. Infected nurse's assistant 'helping' as doctors treat her Health authorities in Spain said a nurse's assistant who is the first person to contract Ebola in Europe in the current outbreak is still in serious condition but doing better. And even as Teresa Romero Ramos lies in a hospital bed, she's doing everything she can to take care of doctors, nurses and herself, said Dr. Marta Arsuaga, who is Romero's doctor and friend. "She is helping us to treat her. ... She was where I am now, so she knows what I have to do," Arsuaga said. Romero's case, like Pham's, has raised serious questions about how equipped hospitals are to cope with the Ebola outbreak. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said Monday that the Madrid hospital treating Romero doesn't meet all the standards set for centers capable of Ebola care. And in a scathing letter, Javier Limon, Romero's husband, said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled. Romero helped care for one of two Spanish missionaries who were brought back to Madrid for treatment after being infected with the virus in West Africa. Both men died of the illness. Besides treating Romero, Spanish authorities are monitoring 81 potential Ebola cases -- 15 in hospitals and 66 at home, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, the ministry said. Romero is stable but remains in serious condition, Antonio Andreu, director of the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, said at a news conference. A spokesman for a special committee created in Spain to keep people informed about Ebola said Spain will have a contagious diseases reference center in each of its regions. Police, firefighters and ambulance personnel, as well as hospital staff, will be trained to deal with Ebola cases. Andreu insisted that Spain's health care professionals have the situation under control. But he said more training will be given to health care workers and new guidelines will be prepared. "Ebola is not a problem of Spain. It is not a problem of the United States," he said. "It's a global problem."

            <highlights>Liberal Catholics and gay activists heralded Vatican's initial statement Vatican had said that gays and lesbians have "gifts to offer" the Christian community Vatican retreats a bit Tuesday after pushback from conservative Catholics Report was a "working document," not the final word from Rome, Vatican says</highlights>
            <text>Rome (CNN) -- Under furious assault from conservative Catholics, the Vatican backtracked Tuesday on its surprisingly positive assessment of gays and same-sex relationships. In a report Monday, the Vatican had said that gays and lesbians have "gifts to offer" the Christian community and acknowledged that same-sex couples can give "precious support" to one other. The statement, an interim report from a closely watched meeting of Catholic clergy here, was widely praised by liberals. It is believed to be the first time the Vatican has said anything positive about gay relationships. One longtime Vatican journalist called the statement a "pastoral earthquake." But many conservatives complained that the statement watered down church teaching and did not accurately reflect their discussions here, where nearly 200 Catholic leaders are meeting to debate pastoral approaches to modern family life. One South African cardinal called Monday's statement, which also included positive language about unmarried couples who cohabitate, "irredeemable." "The message has gone out that this is what the synod is saying, this is what the Catholic Church is saying," said Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier, referring to the special meeting of Catholic clergy gathered here through Saturday. "It's not what we're saying at all." In response to such reactions, the Vatican backtracked a bit Tuesday. In a statement, it said the report on gays and lesbians was a "working document," not the final word from Rome. The Vatican also said that it wanted to welcome gays and lesbians in the church, but not create "the impression of a positive evaluation" of same-sex relationships, or, for that matter, of unmarried couples who live together. But gay rights groups say that's precisely the impression the Vatican gave Monday when it said: "Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community. Are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities? Often they wish to encounter a church that offers them a welcoming home. Are our communities capable of providing that, accepting and valuing their sexual orientation, without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony?" Such statements seem to be in line with the more merciful approach the church has taken toward gays and lesbians under Pope Francis. In 2013, Francis famously said, "Who am I to judge?" gay people. On Monday morning, just before the Vatican released its positive report on gays, Francis preached that laws that do not lead people to Jesus are "dead;" what's more, Christ did "strange things" such as hanging out with sinners and tax collectors, the Pope preached, seemingly tipping his hand about the Vatican's direction. The overarching goal of the meeting here, officially called the Extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family, is to present proposals for a larger gathering to be held in October 2015. Which means there's a long road ahead before any doctrinal or pastoral changes happen in the church. In the meantime, conservative and liberal bishops have been fiercely jousting in the court of public opinion. Monday's report only increased the war of words. Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American and head of the Vatican's supreme court, said the report "lacks a solid foundation in the sacred Scriptures." Other conservatives called it a "betrayal." Opinion: 3 ways the Catholic church should embrace gay rights Liberal Catholics and gay activists, on the other hand, heralded Monday's statement and said that some conservative pushback was probably inevitable, given how hostile some corners of the church are to change. "I actually don't think this is as much of a backtrack as we usually see!" said Marianne Duddy-Burke, head of the gay rights group Dignity USA. "I think that response to this report was swift and intense, and I'm sure many bishops want to be sure people aren't reading more into it than is there," she continued. "However, it is undeniable that there has never been any Vatican document that made positive, respectful statements about same-sex relationships, so that is an undeniable breakthrough." Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, echoed that sentiment. "Regardless of the fact that this is a working document, it is still significant in that it reveals a strong current of affirmative attitudes at high levels in the church towards lesbians and gay people," he said.

            <title>No Catalonia independence referendum for now, Mas says - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>There will be no independence referendum in November, Catalan president says Spain's Constitutional Court suspended the vote to hear government's appeal Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, already has its own parliament, police force</highlights>
            <text>Madrid (CNN) -- Catalonia's November 9 independence referendum will not be held as planned due to the suspension of the vote by Spain's Constitutional Court, Catalan President Artur Mas announced Tuesday in Barcelona. Mas said the decree he recently signed authorizing the referendum "now has no effect," given that the Constitutional Court has accepted the Spanish government's appeal for study, automatically suspending the vote. The Spanish government, in appealing to the Constitutional Court, said the Catalan vote as planned for November 9 was unconstitutional because the constitution holds that all of Spain, not just one region such as Catalonia, must decide on the country's future. Scottish independence vote closely watched Hundreds of thousands of Catalans have demonstrated in recent years for an independence referendum, and they closely watched the recent independence vote in Scotland. Even after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, many Catalans said the key issue was being able to vote in Catalonia on independence, which the Spanish government has opposed. Mas said there will still be a vote on November 9, but it will be organized by the Catalan government under Catalan legislation that has not been blocked by the court. It will be called a "consultation," and will be conducted by volunteers, not the usual electoral officials. And the polling places will be only in Catalan regional government buildings, not at numerous other sites, such as at city halls, many of which had opposed the referendum. Unity in question Mas said the Catalan political parties -- including his nationalist Convergence and Union party -- that had favored the referendum and independence are no longer as united as they recently were on the issue. Leftist pro-independence parties have insisted that the November 9 referendum be held as planned, despite the court's ruling, and some have called for a unilateral declaration of independence. On September 11, Catalan national day, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona for the third year in a row, demanding a vote on independence be held. Self-governance But Madrid argues that Catalonia, which represents one fifth of Spain's economy, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And it insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away. Catalonia is a region of northeastern Spain, with Barcelona -- the second-largest city in Spain -- as its capital. If there is eventually a referendum, voters are expected to be asked a two-part question: "Should Catalonia be a state?" And those who vote yes to that can then vote on the second question: "Should that state be independent?" Polls indicate that a majority of Catalans want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance.

            <highlights>NEW: Defendant Erol Incedal had documents on how to build a bomb, prosecution says NEW: Incedal denies two charges; a second defendant has admitted to one charge Prosecution says Incedal planned either a mass attack or an attack on a prominent person He had the address of a property belonging to former UK PM Tony Blair, the court hears</highlights>
            <text>London (CNN) -- A man was accused Tuesday in a UK court of planning either an indiscriminate "Mumbai-style" attack or an attack against a prominent person -- possibly former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Erol Incedal is accused of preparing terrorist acts with the intention of committing terrorism, and of having documents on how to build a bomb. He denies the charges against him. The trial at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court originally had been planned as a secret trial, but a judge has allowed some reporting of its opening phase. Incedal is accused of possessing documents that refer to bomb making which, according to the prosecution, were found on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its protective case. Police also found a piece of paper tucked inside a glasses case with an address tied to Blair, the prosecution said. However, prosecutors do not allege that Incedal had settled on a plan to attack the former Prime Minister. His iPhone had been used to carry out Internet searches for "ISIS" and "Sham," the court heard, the latter being a reference to Syria. A second defendant, Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, has pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a document that could be used in a terror attack, also on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its case. He will be sentenced at a later date. According to the prosecution, both men had three identical documents on their respective SD cards. They included a "Car Bomb Recognition Guide" and a "bomb making" Word document, parts of which were considered "viable" but also incomplete, the court heard. One document found at Incedal's home had a reference to "Plan," which looks like a checklist including "1 month surveillance," "rent flat nearby," "uniform," and "tools and materials," prosecutors said. Incedal and Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype using code words and aliases to refer to the words "Kalashnikov" and "Mumbai style," the prosecution said. They also allegedly talked of obtaining "straps" -- slang for guns -- the court heard. More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <text>(CNN) -- Three more suspects were arrested Monday in central London in an ongoing terror investigation in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard announced. The men, who are between the ages of 21 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of being "concerned, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism." Two of five men arrested last week were released from custody Monday, the Scotland Yard statement said, leaving six men in custody. Authorities have searched a business in west London and will search four residences in northwest London, police said. After last week's arrests, a UK security source told CNN that authorities may have foiled a terror plot aimed at Britain in its early stages. Islamist terrorism was "the clear reason" for the plot, according to the source. UK police arrest 5th suspect in alleged terror plot  Loading weather data ...</text>

(CNN) -- It's no longer necessary to launch your startup in Silicon Valley -- thanks to the internet, you can do it anywhere. Cities that were once business backwaters have emerged as formidable contenders in the new economy, in many cases leveraging the very things that once disadvantaged them. A lack of infrastructure in places like Nairobi or Lagos, for instance -- once places where it took years to get a fixed line -- have skipped that generation of technology entirely and now offer tantalizing potential for a range of mobile services. "They are not held back by infrastructure issues and they've got nothing to lose by being in the startup space," said Simon Squibb, CEO of Hong Kong-based Nest Investment. "There's a whole opportunity around e-commerce or ed-tech." Without basic access to schools and banks, for example, sub-Saharan Africa has been at the cutting edge of ed-tech developments and mobile financial services. "They get forced into creative solutions and technology can often end up being that creative solution," Squibb said. "They end up being these pockets of activity partly by the need to create the infrastructure that was never built." Even so, those cities that will have the edge in the new technology race often have several fundamentals in place: a functioning education system, the rule of law and access to capital. "For me, Hong Kong still wins out," Squibb said. "Ultimately, liveability is a key a ingredient. You always need to import talent no matter where you are so having a great city for your core team definitely helps."

            <title>Ebola comment on U.S. Airways 845; men in hazmat suits - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-10T03:29:31Z</date>

            <highlights>A man on U.S. Airways Flight 845 made a comment about having Ebola The plane was met by officials in hazmat suits As they escorted him from board, social media video recorded him He tells them that he was joking, that he is "not from Africa"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Ebola is no laughing matter, especially not at airports or on planes, where screenings have gotten tighter. So, when a man on a flight on Wednesday may have joked that he had been to Africa and had the deadly disease, he received a special escort off the plane. Four officials in blue plastic hazmat suits boarded U.S. Airways Flight 845 to retrieve him after it landed in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. "I was just kidding," he could be heard saying in a video posted to social media. "I ain't from Africa!" he continued, as he walked with the officials down the aisle of the plane. The Dominican officials had met the plane coming from Philadelphia on the tarmac "due to a possible health issue on board," U.S. Airways said in statement. "We are following the direction of, and strictly adhering to, all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines in place for airlines in response to the Ebola virus," the airline said. Changes coming to airports in Ebola scare Before the men came aboard in their bubble-like suits, a flight attendant prepared passengers for what they were about to see. Sit down and listen, she told them. "It's going to look worse than it is," she said over the PA system. The glow of cell phone cameras filled the cabin and videos of what happened later hit social media. The attendant spared the passenger who made the comment no indignity. She had seen nothing like this in 36 years of flying, she said. "I think the man that has said this is an idiot, and I'll say that straight out, and if you hear me that's fine," she announced. Then she introduced the men wearing hazmat suits over bulky breathing apparatuses. Passengers reacted with astonishment, anger and fear. "He was coughing and hacking the whole time ... that's not something you joke about," said Bree Manning, a passenger sitting directly behind the man. "People started getting annoyed and just wanted him to be taken off by the police, at the very least," said Manning. Complete coverage on Ebola Others covered their faces and scooted away in their seats."Don't touch this guy," someone could be heard saying. A boo or two went through the cabin as the man walked by. Once he was off, the officials checked the plane then gave it clearance. CNN has not been able to confirm the comment the man allegedly made, but according to local media reports in the Dominican Republic citing the airport's director of operations, it was: "I have Ebola. You're all screwed." Opinion: Get proactive about screening for Ebola  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>High-tech banks look to boutique retail stores for inspiration Focusing on design and consumer interaction, banks hope to be community hubs Banks are incorporating features such as luxurious lounges and touch-screen walls Face-to-face interaction will still be key</highlights>
            <text>Future Finance showcases future trends related to the global financial system. (CNN) -- How would you describe your local bank? Is it small, gray and drab? Are the opening hours short and inconvenient? Does it almost always seem to be low on staff? The banks of the future are looking to inject new life into their outlets -- transforming formally dull environments into efficient, modern, tech-savvy destinations. Long lines and dated designs are being replaced with luxurious lounge areas, tailored service offerings and even robots. Banks, it seems, are about to become a whole lot cooler. Groundbreaking design "The bank branch of the future must be designed around customer engagement," says Martin Shires, branch transformation manager at NCR, a consumer transaction technology company. "Banks need to make customers feel welcome from the moment they walk in the doors." Read: How to make $8 million on Kickstarter As internet banking has taken hold, bank outlets are figuring new ways to pull customers through their doors. The demand for extra features, friendlier spaces and ultra-quick service means that branches are feeling the pressure to up their offerings. Qatar's Barwa Bank shows the shape of things to come with its concept branch created by Italian designers Crea International, which has luxury and efficiency at its heart. Decked with the latest touch-screen technology, lounge-like areas, leather seats and sleek interfaces, the design resembles a high-end hotel lobby or an ultra-cool members club. Luminescent walls are inlaid with arabesque motifs and bank staff sit next to clients at touch-screen tables. Forward-thinking design and high-quality service are finally taking center stage. "Bank branch design of the past focused on security and preventing robberies," says Shires. "Now and in the future, branches need to ... fit into the rhythm of consumers' daily lives." Retail destination But retail banks do not exist in isolation and have to jostle with other stores for customers' attention. Whilst competing with the rise of digital applications and online services, banks also need to keep track of the developments occurring in brick-and-mortar retailers. Read: Nine finance hubs of the future ... they're not where you think "Banks are not just competing with other banks anymore," says Shires, "they are competing against the experiences that consumers have when they walk into an Apple Store or when they buy a latte at the hip coffee shop that accepts mobile payments." Umpqua Bank, based in Oregon, has achieved success with its flagship branch in San Francisco, named international Store of the Year by the Retail Design Institute. Read: Is this the world's fastest computer? Offering extras such as an invitation-only Business Lounge and a Demo Bar where businesses that use the bank can demonstrate their products to visitors, the Retail Design Institute praised the way it incorporated "a number of memorable signature elements to maintain a personal connection" -- including a retro-designed handset used to call the bank's CEO, and a bicycle for customers to use locally. Convenience is key That personal connection will remain crucial to the banking experience. Although banks are embracing digital developments, technology doesn't yet look to displace face-to-face interaction: instead, it looks to enhance it. As ATMs and in-store systems increase their offerings, employees will be able to help customers in a more tailored and efficient way. "Consumers will continue to need banking products and services," says Shires. "Technology is enabling banks to transform their branches to provide greater access and convenience to their customers."

            <highlights>Hurricane Gonzalo is churning through the North Atlantic toward Bermuda Wind speeds are hitting 130 mph Bermuda is prepared, says the premier</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Bermuda says it's ready. Now it awaits the arrival of Hurricane Gonzalo. The eye of the powerful Category 3 storm with its 130 mph winds and higher gusts is expected to pass near the British territory Friday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. "Bermuda we are prepared," said island Premier Michael Dunkley. "Well rehearsed plans for most contingencies are enacted, and as we hope for the best, we are prepared for the worst." Ahead of the storm, Bermuda closed schools, shut down bus and ferry service, and opened up shelters. Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Bermuda on Friday afternoon, according to forecasters, with tropical storm conditions beginning later this morning. Bda thanks for the early prep for the storm and for watching our neighbors and seniors. Hunker down and be safe. God bless. Gonzalo is expected to deliver a power storm surge and significant coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts could hit 6 inches. It will slowly weaken as it approaches the island. 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season facts Bermuda is no stranger to hurricanes, and has weathered a storm or two before. "We will come through this and once this serious storm has passed it will be for us to work together to restore our island home to normal," Dunkley said.  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NEW: Evo Morales says he's dedicating his victory to Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez "We thank the Bolivian people for this new triumph," President Evo Morales says An exit poll says Morales won a third term with 61% of votes Morales is a leftist leader who was once a union leader for coca farmers</highlights>
            <text>La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Incumbent Evo Morales declared victory in Bolivia's presidential vote Sunday. Official results have not been announced, but a national exit poll placed Morales in the lead with 61% of the votes. Victory would mean Morales, of the Movement for Socialism party, would lead the country until 2020 in his third consecutive term as President. "We thank the Bolivian people for this new triumph," Morales told a crowd of cheering supporters in the Bolivian capital of La Paz, vowing to make his country the energy capital of South America. "This democratic triumph of the Bolivian people is dedicated to all the people of Latin America and of the world who fight against capitalism and against imperialism," he said. "This triumph, brothers and sisters, is dedicated to Fidel Castro (and) dedicated to Hugo Chavez, may he rest in peace." Morales, 54, is the South American country's first indigenous President. Four other candidates were vying for Bolivia's presidency in Sunday's vote. As vote tallying began, analysts said that victory was likely for the leftist Latin American leader, given his performance in the polls before the election and Bolivia's economic growth since he took office. "The distance between Evo Morales and the rest is so great, that obviously I don't expect a surprise," economic analyst Carlos Toranzo told CNN en Español. "Most voters are in favor of Morales because they want the economic boom of recent years to continue." Morales, a former union leader for coca growers, won his first election with a campaign that promised a government focused on the needs of the country's poor. But as an ally of Chavez, opponents have accused him of using the system to concentrate power. Last year, a court ruled that he could run again, deciding that his second term in office was his first under the country's new constitution. This time around, he ran under the slogan, "With Evo, we're doing well." Since Morales took office, the country has seen economic growth while many of its neighbors have struggled. Last year, the GDP grew 6.5%, according to government statistics. But some Bolivians say they haven't seen the economic boom cause much of a benefit for their pocketbooks. The normally bustling streets of Bolivia's capital were quiet Sunday. Voting laws prohibit cars from driving on election day Voters told CNN en Español that security and economic issues were key as they cast their ballots. "Bolivia has transformed impressively. I was walking on the streets, talking with the citizens, and all of them are informed. All of them want to vote," said Alvaro Colom, a former Guatemalan President who's heading a mission of election observers from the Organization of American States. Voting went smoothly Sunday, with no major reports of irregularities, Colom said. Morales enjoys widespread popular support at home but has run afoul of some U.S. officials with his outspoken criticisms of capitalism and U.S. drug policies. When he first ran for office, he declared himself a "nightmare" for the United States. In 2008, he expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from Bolivia. Last year, he kicked out the U.S. Agency for International Development, accusing the agency of meddling and conspiring against his government. He told a convention of farm workers in 2011 that he feared U.S. authorities would try to plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking. Amid rumors that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could be on his presidential plane last year, authorities in several European countries refused to let the aircraft land to refuel on its way from Moscow back to Bolivia. Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States for leaking classified documents, wasn't on the plane, but Morales had said he would be willing to give him asylum.

            <text>(CNN) -- A powerful 7.4-magnitude quake shook the Pacific coast of Central America on Tuesday, causing some damage and killing at least one person in El Salvador. The quake was deep (70.5 kilometers or 43 miles) but close to El Salvador's shoreline -- about 64 kilometers from the municipality of Intipuca. El Salvador's Ministry of Weather and Natural Resources initially issued a tsunami warning for the coastal regions, saying the quake was felt throughout the country. It later downgraded it to a tsunami alert. What to know about earthquakes The mayor of San Miguel tweeted some photos that showed light structural damage to the local hospital. Crews responded to at least 12 collapsed homes. Power to the city was knocked out, but has been largely restored. At least one death was reported in San Miguel. A woman was killed when an electrical utility pole fell on her, Mayor Will Salgado said. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <title>Mexico captures alleged Juarez Cartel chief - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-09T20:59:21Z</date>
            <author>Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN</author>
            <highlights>NEW: Mexican federal police have captured Vicente Carrillo Fuentes NEW: Authorities captured him at a checkpoint in Torreon, Mexico Alleged Juarez Cartel boss was one of Mexico's most wanted criminals He's apparently led the cartel since 1997, when his brother died during plastic surgery</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- His cartel helped give Ciudad Juarez its infamous reputation as one of the world's most violent cities. But no shots were fired when Mexican federal police captured alleged Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, authorities said Thursday. The 51-year-old kingpin was detained alongside a bodyguard in a "discreet operation" at a checkpoint in the northern city of Torreon, said Monte Alejandro Rubido, head of Mexico's National Security Council. The driver's license Carrillo Fuentes flashed at a checkpoint concealed his identity. But once he realized he'd been found out, Carrillo Fuentes admitted who he was, Rubido said. Carrillo Fuentes, known as "El Viceroy," was one of Mexico's most wanted alleged criminals. U.S. authorities had been offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction. A list of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's most wanted fugitives describes Carrillo Fuentes as a former Mexican police officer and notes that he "occasionally travels to El Paso, TX." A State Department Narcotics Rewards Program description of the notorious drug lord describes him as a "known user of narcotics" who is "believed to have had plastic surgery" and may have scars around his face. Cartel's influence had been waning In the United States, Carrillo Fuentes faces a number of charges, including drug trafficking, conspiracy, money laundering, tampering with a witness and "ordering the intentional killing of individuals to prevent communication of information," the State Department said. There were five arrest warrants for his capture in Mexico, where authorities were offering a reward of 30 million pesos ($2.2 million). Analysts have said the Juarez Cartel's influence had been waning after a lengthy battle for territory with the Sinaloa Cartel. Some speculate that violence dropped in Ciudad Juarez, located across the border from El Paso, Texas, after the Sinaloa Cartel won the fight for control. But at one time, the Juarez Cartel was one of the most powerful in Mexico. Its former leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes was known as the "Lord of the Skies" because of the large fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. He died while undergoing plastic surgery in 1997, leaving his brother, Vicente, in charge of the cartel. Arrest comes as government faces criticism His reported arrest comes a week after another top cartel leader was caught. Authorities said last week that they arrested Hector Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, while he was dining in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. The high-profile captures come as Mexican authorities face fierce public criticism over a surge in violence in Iguala, where 43 students went missing during a recent night of shootouts. On Monday, the government ordered local police to lay down their weapons and sent federal forces to the area, where investigators have found mass graves full of unidentified human remains. Critics accuse local authorities of involvement in the grisly crime, and say the government hasn't done enough to solve it. So far, 34 people have been detained in connection with the case, including nearly two dozen local police officers, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told reporters Thursday. Hours later at another press conference, Murillo trumpeted news of Carrillo Fuentes' capture as the "result of enormous effort by the federal government," noting that it shows how much authorities have strengthened their abilities in investigation and intelligence. "He was one of the most important of the most important that Mexican justice had to capture," he said. CNN en Español's Fidel Gutierrez and Danny Guerra contributed to this report.

            <title>What to tell your kid on Columbus Day (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-10T16:51:05Z</date>
            <author>David M. Perry</author>
            <highlights>David Perry's daughter came home from school with some notions about Columbus Much of what we think we know about the explorer turns out to be incorrect, Perry says Perry: Columbus didn't prove Earth was round, didn't really "discover" a continent</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: David M. Perry is an associate professor of history at Dominican University in Illinois. He writes regularly at the blog How Did We Get Into This Mess? Follow him on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- In October 2013, my daughter came home from school excited about Christopher Columbus. He had come to visit her class! During his visit, he told the children that he had figured out the world was round and then bravely led his crew to discover America. Then they all made telescopes. As a father and history professor, I was caught off-guard. Columbus actually didn't figure out the world was round. He didn't really discover America, either. And telescopes weren't around until about a century after Columbus died. But what do you tell a 5-year-old who has bought into a myth? And how do you do it without constructing an anti-myth, pegging the explorer as one of the most evil people to walk the Earth? What should we tell our children about Columbus? I asked that question of William Phillips, professor of history at the University of Minnesota and co-author of "The Worlds of Christopher Columbus," and of LeAnne Howe, the Eidson Professor in American Literature at the University of Georgia and an enrolled member of the Choctaw Nation. In both cases, professors started from the same principle: Tell the kids the truth. The story goes that Columbus had to persevere against the odds to get support for his venture, because everyone but him believed the Earth was flat. This just isn't true. The ancient Greeks proved that the Earth was round about 2,000 years ago, and one even used the shadow of the Earth on the moon during an eclipse to estimate its circumference. The problem for Columbus is that he was bad at math and worse at geography, and everyone with an education knew it. "He failed to get funding for a long time," Phillips wrote, "because his calculations of the earth were on the small side, he thought that dry land covered more of the sphere than it does, and he believed Japan was some 1500 miles off the coast of China." In other words, most people knew roughly the distance between the west coast of Europe and the east coast of Asia but believed it was filled with a vast ocean in which Columbus would surely die. Instead of Columbus Day, cities celebrate Indigenous People's Day Columbus was stubborn. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, he refused to give up his plan, and because he was so stubborn, he kept fighting for funding until he finally broke through to the Queen of Spain. His stubbornness also, as both professors noted, kept him from ever admitting that he hadn't reached Asia. For Columbus, the idea of a whole new continent and unknown peoples just didn't fit his worldview. The indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, however, were used to hosting strange arrivals from all over the Americas in their towns, according to Howe. Their settlements were decades or even centuries old, built in part on transcontinental trade, and Columbus did not seem so outlandish. These were settled lands with rich societies, not, as often depicted, simple or primitive. That's one of the real tragedies of the story of Columbus and probably the hardest part to explain to children. The complex indigenous societies of the Americas were decimated by exposure to Old World diseases, crumbling under the weight of epidemic. By the time later waves of settlers arrived in North America, they often found wilderness. It was a new wilderness, born of drastic population decline. Columbus didn't know that his voyage would spread diseases across the continents, of course, but disease wasn't the only problem. Columbus sailed the ocean blue not for the love of exploration but because he wanted access to Asian gold. Instead, he found marvelous soft cotton, which Howe says was far superior to similar cloth in Europe. He also took slaves for display back home and to work in his conquered lands. Cloth and slavery defined the Columbian exchange from the beginning. Despite all this, it's not correct to simply demonize Columbus. He was a brave man, launching his ships into an uncertain fate, driven by greed, faith and hope. Like many brave men, he believed very strongly that he knew what he was doing -- even though he was wrong about so many details -- and it's OK to be impressed by his bravery. Moreover, his voyages had an undeniable historical impact, sparking the great age of Atlantic exploration, trade and eventually colonization by Europeans. In a very real way, this era reshaped the world, the languages we speak, the religions we follow, the foods we eat and the diseases we catch. I don't know if that's a reason to have a school holiday, exactly, but it's definitely worth remembering. So if your child comes home in the leadup to Columbus Day, like mine did, full of praise for the explorer's bravery and vision, that's a fine place to start, even if he didn't really "discover" the Americas or figure out that the Earth was round. He was, indeed, brave. But then explain that brave people can do bad things, and worse things can happen without any planning. That's one of the lessons of history.

            <text>(CNN) -- A lightning strike killed 11 members of an indigenous tribe in northern Colombia Monday after an electrical storm broke out during an early morning ritual. Helicopters airlifted 13 injured people to hospitals for treatment, Gen. German Saavedra told reporters. The lightning struck around 3 a.m. Monday during a ritual of the Wiwa community's government in the remote Sierra Nevada mountains, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. Bernardo Gil Moscote, a member of the community, told Colombia's El Tiempo newspaper that villagers were gathered in a ceremonial hut to discuss problems the community was facing. He had stepped out to get a drink when he heard crashing thunder that shook the mountains. One dead, 13 injured after lightning strikes at beach "When I got back, the hut was on fire," he told the newspaper, "and you only heard men screaming." Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos tweeted his condolences and said military and police helicopters were evacuating the victims. "I know that this is normal, that it is something that comes from nature, but nothing like this has ever happened there," said Marta Cecilia Gil, who tearfully told Caracol her brother and brother-in-law died in the lightning strike.

            <highlights>NEW: With more than 99% of votes counted, Dilma Rousseff has more than 41% of votes NEW: Exit polls say she'll face Aecio Neves in a runoff Rousseff is Brazil's first female President and was once a Marxist rebel Neves, an economist, is a well known career politician who vows to fight inflation</highlights>
            <text>Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's presidential vote is headed for a runoff. Preliminary election results from the South American country show President Dilma Rousseff in the lead. But she didn't get the majority necessary to win in the first round. With more than 99% of votes counted, Rousseff had 41.56% of votes, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court said. Aecio Neves was in second place with 33.60%. And Marina Silva was in third place with 21.30%. Exit polls Sunday indicated there would be a runoff between Rousseff, the incumbent, and Neves, a center-right candidate. In a poll conducted by the Ibope public research firm, Rousseff won 44% of votes, Neves won 30% and Silva won 22%. Silva, an environmentalist candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party, had gained momentum and backing from a growing number of supporters leading up to the vote, with polls before the election placing her in second place. She joined the race after candidate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash and was seen as a political outsider who could combat corruption. But while she succeeded in gaining much broader support that polls had initially predicted for her party, her third-place finish puts her out of the running for the presidency. Rousseff, 66, was once a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the early 1970s during Brazil's former dictatorship. With her trademark pixie-short hair style and thick glasses, she became one of most Brazil's most wanted fugitives, branded by some as a "subversive Joan of Arc." She has a solid track record in running the executive office. Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She democratized Brazil's electricity sector through the "Luz Para Todos" (Light for All) program, which made electricity widely available, even in rural areas. Rousseff presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil, but she took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent. Streets filled with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators questioning the morality of pumping so much money into stadiums instead of programs to fight poverty and build infrastructure. Rousseff defended the spending, saying the vast majority of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects were spent on projects for the nation, not the soccer tournament. And Rousseff claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty. "We have also mainstreamed into the middle class no less than 42 million people," she has said. But inflation is now weighing down that progress. Neves, a 54-year-old economist, is a well-known name and a career politician. His campaign slogan promises reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country: "The sure path for Brazil to really change." The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country's strongest. His grandfather, Tancredo Neves, was elected to become Brazil's president in 1985 but died before taking office. Neves says he began his political career campaigning at his grandfather's side. "What motivates me in politics is an enormous love of Brazil, a limitless desire to see things improve, to see Brazil go the right way," he says in a campaign video. While he'd been trailing in some polls leading up to the election, Neves said the only poll that mattered was Sunday's official vote. "Let's get to the second round," he said in a YouTube video on Saturday. Both Rousseff and Neves thanked supporters in speeches Sunday night. Rousseff has promised her second term will be different, running under the slogan of "New Government, New Ideas." "Once again, the people have honored me with their trust by giving me victory in the first round," she said. Em Belo Horizonte, Aécio é carregado por populares.#Aécio45 https://t.co/jiTEve6YLa A video posted on Neves' Twitter feed Sunday night showed cheering supporters carrying him as cameras flashed. This has been one of the tightest election competitions in recent years, and it's likely to intensify in the coming weeks, with both candidates vying for the votes that went to Silva in the first round. There will be three more weeks of campaigning before the runoff. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta.

            <highlights>Mexican federal forces are taking over security in the municipality of Iguala 43 students went missing there more than a week ago, and mass graves were found "I am outraged and troubled by this situation," Mexico's President says</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- Federal troops are on the way to a southern Mexican town where 43 students went missing, and local police have been ordered to lay down their weapons. Mexico's federal Gendarmerie force will take over security in the southern municipality of Iguala along with the Mexican Army, the head of the country's National Security council told reporters Monday. Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, head of the commission, said President Enrique Peña Nieto had ordered the takeover, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Mexican Army and Federal Police forces are on the way to the municipality, where authorities are investigating the disappearance of 43 students after a night of violence last month. Authorities have accused local police of involvement in shootouts the night of September 26, when gunmen opened fire on buses carrying dozens of students and soccer players. Since then, 43 students from a rural teachers' college have been missing. Investigators found unmarked mass graves near the town over the weekend, and they say the graves could be connected to the case. State prosecutors say the remains of at least 28 people were in the graves, but the bodies were covered with gasoline and burned before they were buried, and it could take months to identify them. La @PoliciaFedMx traslada contingente a #Iguala #Guerrero para realizar tareas de seguridad. pic.twitter.com/0IDYAnwTrq On their Twitter account Monday, Mexican Federal Police posted a photograph of vehicles on the way to Iguala, lights flashing. The case has drawn widespread attention and sharp criticism of officials in Iguala and Mexico's Guerrero state. "Like all of Mexican society, I am outraged and troubled by this situation, and I assure you there will not be impunity," Peña Nieto said in a Twitter post Monday. Mexico's Attorney General's Office also said Monday that it was forming a special team to investigate the students' disappearance. CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.

            <title>ISIS: Will it 'weaponize' foreign fighters? (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T20:08:48Z</date>

            <highlights>Likelihood of foreign fighters planning attacks in West varies by where they were, writer says ISIS less interested in planning attacks overseas than al Qaeda, Thomas Hegghammer says ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda has, he says</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: Thomas Hegghammer is director of terrorism research at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and author of "Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism since 1979." The views expressed are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- How big a threat do foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq pose to the West? It's a question that has been much on the mind of policymakers and commentators, especially since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the United States was ramping up its military role in the region. Will such fighters return with dangerous new skills and experience that they are determined to use against their home country? Or is the potential threat by these fighters overhyped? The answer depends on what the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria decides to do with them. So far, jihadi groups in Syria have not been sending foreign fighters on attack missions in the West in any sort of systematic way. But if the group decides to "weaponize" its fighters, we will have a much bigger problem on our hands. Since 2011, around 3,000 Western Muslims have gone to Syria, where many have joined the most radical elements of the insurgency. And there is no question that some of these individuals will pose a terrorist threat when they return. We know this because it has already happened -- Syria veterans are suspected of involvement in one successful and at least six unsuccessful alleged attacks in Europe and Australia over the past year. Yet there is no reason to expect all -- or even a majority -- of these people to try to attack us in the future. During my research, I have found that of all Western Muslims who joined conflict zones before 2011, no more than one in nine moved on to terrorism in the West. In fact, this estimate is probably at the high end -- the real historical average may be closer to one in 15 or 20. This suggests that the more helpful question is therefore not whether the foreign fighters in Syria are a threat, but what proportion of them will be. Can we not simply assume that somewhere between one in nine or one in 20 of the fighters in Syria will become terrorists, and try to plan accordingly? Unfortunately, it's not that simple because the "blowback rate" -- the proportion of outgoing fighters who later return to attack -- varies significantly between destinations. Take the conflict in Somalia, for example, which attracted hundreds of Western foreign fighters in the previous decade, but produced few attacking returnees. In contrast, of those who went to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the same period, a substantial proportion plotted attacks on their return. So, how can we determine whether Syria will produce foreign fighters that are more like Somalia or more like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of blowback? It largely depends on whether you have a group in the theater of conflict that strategically targets the West. For example, the Afghanistan-Pakistan area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so-called al Qaeda Central, a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the West. Al Qaeda excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the Taliban and persuading them to undertake attacks in Europe or the United States instead. Most other jihadi groups, even al Qaeda's own affiliates, are not equally invested in this strategy. True, they all spout anti-American rhetoric and may even dabble in anti-Western extremist actions. But they invest the bulk of their resources in local operations. And so far, that has been true of ISIS, too. Of course, if you look for anti-Western statements and links to potential international plots, you will find them. But these indications actually make up a small proportion of the group's overall ideological production and military operations. The fact is that there is little to suggest that ISIS has had a sustained and centrally directed global operations program. This is one of the reasons why the blowback rate from Syria has so far been low, several plots notwithstanding. Six plots involving a total of, say, 10 or 20 Syria veterans make for a blowback rate of one in 150 or one in 300. Yes, it is still early in the conflict, and several plots may have gone unreported. But Syria is still looking like a low blowback foreign fighter destination. There is, however, the question of whether Western intervention in Iraq and Syria will cause ISIS to go global. Certainly, the group has taken a more anti-Western posture over the past few months. It has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States, and it has beheaded American hostages in Syria. In a noteworthy statement, for example, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani recently called on supporters worldwide to attack members of the coalition in any way possible. So we should not be surprised if ISIS embarks on a limited but sustained external operations effort, along the lines of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, which combines a primarily local agenda with a small global side operation. Ultimately, though, ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda Central has. The organization is not designed for that, and such a strategy is not compatible with its state-building ambitions. Besides, ISIS' threats have so far differed in tone from those of al Qaeda Central. Where the latter says, in effect, that "we're coming at you regardless," ISIS has basically been saying, "We'll come at you if you attack us." It's a somewhat more reluctant declaration of war. None of this is to suggest that some foreign fighters in Syria won't come back and do bad things regardless of what ISIS' leaders choose to do -- they undoubtedly will. And it is also important to remember one more thing, namely that although the early signs suggest that the threat from foreign fighters returning is low, the potential for attacks is still there. Indeed, if ISIS starts to "weaponize" its Western recruits in a strategic way, then the foreign fighter threat will take on a more significant -- and more deadly -- complexion than it has so far.

            <title>Why we must talk to the bad guys -- even ISIS - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-15T11:23:01Z</date>

            <highlights>Revenge is not the best way to go about tackling terrorist groups, writes Jonathan Powell History suggests you need a coolly thought out strategy, he says Powell: Talking is not an alternative to fighting -- they have to go hand in hand All conflicts are capable of resolution, he writes</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: Jonathan Powell was Chief of Staff for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and is now head of the charity Inter-Mediate. His book "Talking to Terrorists How to End Armed Conflicts" is published by Bodley Head. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. London (CNN) -- When people watch the cold-blooded beheading of a western journalist on TV they react emotionally. They want revenge. So do I. But I have come to understand that is not the best way to go about tackling terrorist groups. History suggests you need a coolly thought-out strategy if you want to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIS as U.S. President Barack Obama put it, rather than a knee-jerk reaction. Colin Parry's 12-year-old son Tim died in his arms after being blown up by an IRA bomb in the northern English town of Warrington in 1993. Last week at Cheltenham Literary Festival Parry said that if he had known that Prime Minister John Major had been corresponding with the IRA when that bomb went off he would have been horrified. But if you had asked him six months later he said he would have welcomed Major's attempt to end the conflict through talking. READ: ISIS states its justification for the enslavement of women If even victims can see the wisdom of talking to terrorists why can't policy makers? I have been accused of being naive for even suggesting the idea. But it is not an idea I have pulled out of thin air -- a study of conflicts over the last 30 years shows that governments when confronted by a new terrorist group invariably say they won't talk to them but nearly always end up doing so from South Africa to El Salvador to Indonesia. This is not to say that talking is an alternative to fighting -- they have to go hand in hand. Nor am I suggesting sitting down with ISIS now to negotiate even if they were prepared to sit down with us. Negotiations can only happen when the conditions are right, usually when a mutually hurting stalemate is in place and both sides realize they cannot win by military means. But people forget how long the process leading up to a successful negotiation can take. The British government opened up a secret channel to the IRA in 1972 and yet the real negotiations only happened in 1991-93 when Major opened his correspondence with Irish republican politician Martin McGuinness. It takes a long time for armed groups to realize that their demands are unachievable and to start to consider what else they would settle for. READ: Who's doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS The same is true of ISIS. No one is going to agree to a universal caliphate. But once ISIS realizes they can't win then they may be prepared to talk and we need to open a secret channel now to give time to establish enough trust to move to negotiations when the moment comes. There are practical things we can talk to them about. The ex-Baathists and ex-Iraqi army offices that make up a major part of the ISIS force have genuine grievances about the way they were treated by the sectarian Maliki government. We can discuss with them ways of ensuring Sunnis have a powerful voice in a Shia majority Iraq. The real problem is that each new terrorist group comes as a surprise to us. The philosopher John Gray considers that the "obstacle to coping with the terrorist threat is the belief that it is unlike anything in the past." I suggested in 2008 when I had left government that on the basis of my experience in Northern Ireland we ought to speak to Hamas, the Taliban and al Qaeda. The government spokesman dismissed my comments saying that while Her Majesty's Government might be prepared to talk to the IRA and the PLO, they would never talk to these new groups. In the subsequent six years however the Israeli and U.S. governments have negotiated a cease-fire with Hamas, the U.S. government has negotiated the release of Sergeant Bowe Berghdal with the Taliban and a former Director-General of MI5 has said we should be talking to al Qaeda. If the position can change so quickly on these groups then there is every reason to suppose the same can happen with ISIS. Terrorism is not going to disappear even if we deal with al Qaeda and ISIS. People keep hoping for technological solutions like drones or jungle penetrating radar, but as fast as we develop them the terrorists find a way round them. So we should recognize that we already have the only tools we will ever have for dealing with terrorism and those are fighting and talking. By using only one tool, counter terrorism measures, we are not going to solve the problem unless we think we can kill each and every one of them. What we need to do is to combine security pressure down on the terrorist group with giving them a political way out through talking. Negotiations with terrorists are almost never successful straight away. Eventual success is built on multiple failures as in Northern Ireland and Spain. But all conflicts are capable of resolution. What we need is leaders who believe they can solve the problem and are willing to take the necessary risks to do so. Above all we need to learn from our past mistakes and successes instead of trying to reinvent the wheel very time we meet a new armed group.

A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of "The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television." Follow her on Twitter @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Just when you thought it was impossible for ISIS to become any more contemptible, the group in its latest publication boasts of its success in bringing the return of slavery. More specifically, it announced and provided elaborate justification for the enslavement of women. We didn't need a new propaganda effort from the self-appointed Islamic State to know the nightmare that has befallen women in territories captured by its fighters. Now we've had a look at the twisted logic that rationalizes sexual exploitation, killing and enslavement of women and young girls. Is it any wonder then that women in Iraq and Syria have moved to the forefront of the war against ISIS? They have taken up arms, organized civil protests and warned the world about the threat that ISIS poses. A woman is leading Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in the city of Kobani, Syria. And a substantial number -- more than one third -- of the Kurdish battlefield troops in Syria are women. One reason they fight is that women have more to lose than anyone else. For a time, the rumors seemed so extreme, so outlandish, that they were met with a dose of skepticism: Talk of slave markets, mass kidnappings, women treated as spoils of war distributed among the victorious fighters, sounded like tales from a historic account, not of a 21st-century conflict. But in 2014, using the Internet, ISIS described what it did with members of Iraq's Yazidi minority: "After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to Sharia amongst the fighters of the Islamic State. ..." The explanation included "scholarly analysis" to justify the religious logic and social benefits of reviving the slavery of women. "One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia, or Islamic law." It seems pointless to discuss religious doctrine with a group determined to kill its way into the imposition of seventh-century norms more than 1,400 years after they were written. A number of top Muslim clerics have rejected ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law. And some Muslims argue the Quran is actually egalitarian. ISIS, in contrast, finds slavery and the holding of concubines a beneficial practice, writing that "a number of contemporary scholars" say the end of slavery has led to an increase in "adultery, fornication, etc." The latest publication confirms what human rights investigators and survivors of ISIS have reported. The United Nations says slave markets now operate in Raqqa, the ISIS "capital" in Syria, and in Mosul, until recently a modern city in Iraq. U.N. investigators interviewed witnesses, who told of women taken captive by ISIS, sexually abused and handed to slave traders. The United Nations estimates there are at least 2,500 victims. Others say the number may be much higher. When Kurdish forces recaptured Mosul Dam, they reportedly said they found a woman naked and tied up, who had been raped repeatedly by ISIS men. Similar reports have come from other ISIS-controlled areas. Just like the publicized beheading of captives has a strategic purpose, the treatment of women as battlefield loot is a way of enticing new recruits. But it is also a powerful motivation for women to join the fight. In the battle over Kobani, just across the border from Turkey, ground troops are led by two top officers of the YPG, the Kurdish People's Protection Units. One of them is a woman, Mayssa Abdo, known in the battlefield as Narin Afrin. About 35% of YPG's forces are women. Then there is YPJ, the Women's Protection Unit, counting 7,500 uniformed fighters, some barely bigger than their rifles. Kurdish women from Turkey have volunteered to fight alongside their Kurdish brethren in Syria. Inside Mosul, women organized resistance against ISIS' oppressive rule. The women's rights activist Sameera Salih al-Nuaimy denounced ISIS atrocities on social media. She was arrested, tortured and executed by an ISIS firing squad Women physicians in Mosul organized a strike when ISIS ordered them to cover their faces. At least one of the strikers was executed, as have been countless female lawyers, doctors and other professional women. A turning point in global attention to the threat posed by ISIS came in August, when a woman, a Yazidi legislator, took the floor in the Iraqi parliament, saying ISIS was committing genocide against Iraq's Yazidis. "Mr. Speaker," cried out Vian Dakhil, the only Yazidi member of parliament, "We are being slaughtered. We are being exterminated." Since then, while the United States helped save thousands of Yazidis and started bombing ISIS without putting "boots on the ground," countless women, mostly Kurdish, have laced up their boots and headed to the battlefield. The worst of ISIS treatment is reserved for "infidels," or for those defying their orders. In areas under ISIS control, women are required to observe strict clothing rules and are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative. Violators can be whipped or even executed. It's worth remembering that many of the women facing these restrictions had been living modern lives. Just when it seemed ISIS could not be more offensive and threatening, it has provided everyone, especially, women even more reasons to fight back.

            <title>ISIS pushed back with help of U.S. airstrikes in Kobani - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-16T15:23:53Z</date>

            <highlights>NEW: U.S. jets are increasing bombing of Kobani due to heavier ISIS presence NEW: Pentagon says that doesn't mean U.S. strategy is shifting on the city's value 14 U.S. airstrikes on ISIS positions in Kobani help Kurdish fighters turn the tide, activist says ISIS gaining ground in Iraq's Anbar province, local official says</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- The increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the Syrian city of Kobani reflects more targets of opportunity, not a change in the campaign against the vicious Islamist group, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday. The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there. "There's been no strategic shift here, as far as I know, at least from the military perspective, about Kobani or any other town," Rear Adm. John Kirby said, making a unique appearance at the State Department's daily briefing. In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, not far from the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands. "We never said Kobani didn't matter," Kirby said. "What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it." Kirby said the number of airstrikes in Syria or Iraq depends on how "target rich" an area is. The past few days around Kobani have seen more ISIS targets, he said. There are more ISIS fights there with more force, Kirby said. U.S. fighter jets conducted at least 14 raids near Kobani on Wednesday and Thursday, according to U.S. Central Command. Initial reports show the strikes hit 19 ISIS buildings and 10 other targets, including command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, the U.S. military said. According to CNN's math, that makes 122 strikes on the city, most of any town in what the military recently labeled Operation Inherent Resolve. Street by street The battle for Kobani has become a street fight over control of hills and neighborhoods and witnessed by TV cameras pointed there from Turkey. These strikes on small targets in Kobani, such as sniper positions, are "tactical" in nature -- without the widespread "strategic" affect against ISIS that U.S. officials have said is the foundation for the U.S. operation in Syria, a senior U.S. military official told CNN's Barbara Starr. "It's not 'whack-a-mole,' " Kirby said. "The idea isn't to just put a warhead on a forehead every single day. The idea is to try to get at their ability to sustain themselves and to disrupt their strategy." One Kurdish fighter told CNN Thursday that ISIS has been forced from many parts of the city, but still controls some key buildings including the hospital and the important Asayish building in the middle of Kobani, which served as headquarters for the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG. Kurdish forces have control of the southwest entrance of the city and have taken some buildings back from ISIS fighters in one neighborhood, next to the heavily contested eastern industrial area of the city. The airstrikes over the past few days have helped Kurdish YPG fighters turn into an offensive rather than a defensive force, one activist said. But, he adds, "there is still street fighting in the east and in the south" of Kobani. "This is an infantry battle now and traditional reconnaissance does not work," said Anthony Cordesman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It's hard to get correct information, making the results of the airstrikes indecisive, he said. A U.S. Defense officials told CNN that good weather played a role in the Kobani airstrikes, because the targets were readily located by overhead surveillance. In Iraq on the other hand, bad weather has forced a slowdown in strikes, the official said. Joint Chiefs chairman: 'I don't see' Baghdad falling ISIS pushing ahead in Iraq? Militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Fallujah, an Anbar province official said Thursday. ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thusday. Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town. Obama on ISIS: Expect 'long-term campaign' ISIS advances have slowed and the group has changed formation, communication and tactics making them "harder to hit," Kirby said. He called for "strategic patience" in measuring the success of the operation. Militants continue to surround a major airbase in the Iraq's Anbar province and U.S. officials say they're continuing airstrikes there to help Iraqi forces. "In Anbar province, our hope is to stop or halt that tactical initiative and momentum that they (ISIS) have," Gen. John Allen, the special presidential envoy on ISIS, said Wednesday. It is clear that ISIS "has made substantial gains in Iraq," he said. A senior U.S. military official told CNN the fight in Anbar is "very tough," but "Iraqi forces are holding their own in some places." U.S. officials do not see the Ein Al-Assad military base in Anbar on the verge of being overrun by ISIS, the official said. Opinion: Why we must talk to the bad guys --- even ISIS ISIS car bomb in Baghdad At least five people were killed and 15 were injured when two car bombs exploded in the al-Hurriya Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad Thursday, according to police. At least two people died when another car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint near al-Talbiya Bridge in eastern Baghdad. ISIS released a statement claiming responsibility for the bombings.

            <highlights>U.S. Central Command says it's not aware of ISIS conducting any flight operations ISIS has three warplanes in Syria, a London-based Syrian opposition group claims Former Iraqi military officers are training members of ISIS to fly the planes, it reports ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of Iraq</highlights>
            <text>Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Could ISIS fighters be training as warplane pilots capable of turning their weapons on coalition aircraft? That's the worrying prospect suggested by an unverified report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that ISIS has three warplanes in its possession in northern Syria. The Syrian opposition group also claims, citing reliable sources in Syria, that former Iraqi military officers are training members of the Sunni extremist militant group to fly them. The planes are at the Al-Jarrah military airport east of the contested city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The former Iraqi military officers are among those who have joined ISIS, and people living near the airport have said that they recently saw an airplane flying at low altitude after it took off, according to the Observatory. Information on how the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State and is also known as ISIL, obtained the planes, or the trainees' previous level of familiarity with flight, wasn't immediately available. CNN has not independently verified the report. However, the U.S. Central Command sought to pour cold water on the report. "We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere," said spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder. "We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be." ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of western and northern Iraq, for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate. Kobani airstrikes target ISIS This week has seen an increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Aleppo. The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there. The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani. "What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it," said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN Friday that Kobani is not tactically or militarily very important -- but has taken on a certain significance. "It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. "However, it has attracted the attention of the world. "The world is watching the coalition fight ISIS and, because of that, a victory by either side in Kobani will have a psychological and strategic communication victory that far outweighs the tactical military victory to whichever side wins." In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, on the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands. Anbar advances Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday. ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thursday. Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town. The deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi, told CNN by phone Friday that a curfew has been imposed on the city of Ramadi until further notice. This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. The curfew was imposed Thursday night. Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with "heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another." Car bomb attacks claimed by ISIS targeted Shia areas of Baghdad Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more. CNN's Raja Razek reported from near Suruc, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Jason Hanna in Atlanta. CNN's Barbara Starr and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.

            <title>Joint Chiefs chairman: 'I don't see' Baghdad falling - CNN.com</title>
            <date>2014-10-15T17:40:05Z</date>
            <author>Ashley Fantz, CNN</author>
            <highlights>NEW: Chairman of Joint Chiefs faults the Iraqi government On possibly putting sending in ground troops, Dempsey said no but added "war is discovery" Dempsey: "I'm worried about it because we know so little" about Ebola Operation against ISIS is called "Inherent Resolve"</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- The U.S. has a "winning strategy" to defeat ISIS, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN's Kyra Phillips in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. He added that he "can't foresee" sending "large ground combat forces into Iraq." Gen. Martin Dempsey also touched on his concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus and what's more to come in the coalition battle against murderous Islamic extremists. ISIS has inched closer to the Iraqi capital Baghdad this week and continued fighting in strategically important Anbar Province. Is it possible that ISIS could gain control of Baghdad? "I don't see that happening," he said. "I'm confident we can assist the Iraqis to keep Baghdad from falling." However, Iraqi forces, some of whom abandoned their posts when ISIS began its assault on Iraq, need more training, Dempsey said. Still, they have "established a fairly formidable defensive perimeter around Baghdad" that Dempsey characterized as "a very thick and deep defense." Dempsey repeated what he said before Congress weeks ago, stressing that doesn't see a need to put troops on the ground in the fight against ISIS. He was firm on the controversial notion that American troops could once again head back into Iraq to fight after being involved in a conflict that stretched from 2003 to 2011. And yet he also told CNN that "war is discovery" and that if the situation evolves to the point where ground troops are necessary, he will evaluate that and make recommendations to President Barack Obama. There are 12 teams of military advisers in Iraq now, he said. Dempsey said the U.S. got a "significant commitment" from other members of the international coalition to add advisory teams. Dempsey said the plan is to set up three bases where the U.S. and others can train Iraqi security forces who are battling ISIS on the ground, along with Kurdish fighting forces. He then reiterated that "war is discovery," stressed that ISIS is a "national security threat" and said that airstrikes alone will not beat ISIS though they have forced the group to change "the way it's moving." Fighting ISIS is going to take "patience," Dempsey said, so it's critical that the U.S. and the coalition show progress soon. For now, "we're on the right path." Dempsey also revealed that the international coalition's operation against ISIS has a name: "Inherent Resolve." The name, to him, means that "we need to be able to be credible and sustainable over time in order to accomplish the mission that we've been given." 'We gave Iraq a chance' The chairman put much of the blame for the growth of ISIS on the Iraqi government. Despite airstrikes and international outrage, the terror group is overrunning Iraqi forces and making significant strides in Syria. "We gave Iraq a chance -- an opportunity," Dempsey said, talking about the war. "They failed to take that opportunity." "The coaching, and teaching, and mentoring, the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of Iraq that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population, which created an environment in which ISIL could return and could flourish," he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS. When asked who in the U.S. government underestimated ISIS, Dempsey said: "I think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the Iraqi armed forces had eroded and wouldn't stand and face ISIL. I think we all missed that." Dempsey alarmed about Ebola months ago The chairman said he has been concerned about Ebola as a global threat for at least 90 days. "I'm worried about it because we know so little about (Ebola)," he said, adding that his worry is stoked by seemingly conflicting information about how the virus can be spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the deadly virus, which originated in Africa, can be passed only through direct contact with bodily fluids when a person suffering from it exhibits symptoms. "If you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room, one will say, 'No there is no way it will ever become airborne, but it could mutate so it could be harder to discover,' " and another might say something completely different, Dempsey said. He said he is alarmed by the World Health Organization's warning that Ebola cases could increase and the virus could mutate. "Then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem," he said. "I don't know who is right. I don't want to take that chance, so I am taking it very seriously."  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NEW: John Kerry says Turkey is on board with coalition fighting ISIS President Obama says effort to destroy ISIS will have ups and downs Iraqi police captain, sources: ISIS has surrounded one of Iraq's largest air bases ISIS continues its assault on Syria's Kobani; coalition fights back with airstrikes</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- ISIS appears to have gained more ground in Iraq. Islamic State fighters surrounded one of Iraq's largest air bases Tuesday, a police captain in Anbar province and other security sources told CNN. The militants are preparing to launch an attack on Ein Al-Assad military airbase, which is halfway between Hit and Haditha, said Anbar police Capt. Omar Mohamad Hanin. Anbar has been largely overrun by ISIS, which has been waging war for months in order to establish a caliphate -- or a society run by strict Sharia law. It has also taken over large swaths of Syria, near the border with Turkey. Coalition forces have been trying to battle back, but ISIS is getting into position in Iraq with rocket launchers and tanks in villages to the south and east of Ein Al-Assad, Hanin said. President Barack Obama said he is focused on the fighting taking place in Anbar and vowed airstrikes will continue there and elsewhere. "This is going to be a long-term campaign, there are no quick fixes involved," he said Tuesday at Joint Base Andrews, during a meeting of military leaders from 22 countries who are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. "We're still in the early stages," the President said. "As with any military efforts there will be days of progress and there will be periods of setback, but our coalition is united behind this long-term effort." Nearly 60 countries are now part of the effort to stop ISIS. Two deadly car bombs exploded in Baghdad on Monday and one on Tuesday. The militants claimed they were behind the blasts. One targeted the police checkpoint in the Shiite neighborhood of Khadimiya. Four people were killed and 12 others were injured when a car bomb being driven by a someone on a suicide mission exploded in an area called al-Utayfia. The target was a security checkpoint at one of the entrances to the predominately Shiite neighborhood, police officials told CNN. ISIS released a statement on its media site claiming that the al-Khadimiya attack killed a member of the Iraqi Parliament, Ahmad al-Khafaji, who was a member of the Badr Organization, a main Shiite bloc in the government. On the surface, Badgad remained calm Tuesday, despite ISIS advances from the west. Ali, who sells fish at a market, noted that ISIS has taken control of even more territory since the coalition airstrikes began. Nearby, Walid, who sells fruit and has two sons in the Iraqi army, said the airstrikes are "like theater." The Iraqi army's track record in fighting ISIS is not good. It has lost control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and is now struggling to keep control over Anbar. Obama on ISIS: Expect 'long-term campaign' ISIS advances in Syria In Syria, ISIS fighters bombed and blasted their way through the strategic city of Kobani. Columns of smoke rose as the sound of gunfire erupted. Coalition airpower -- aided by Saudi Arabia -- has been focused intensely on Syria. U.S. Central Command said Tuesday that it had bombarded ISIS near Kobani, using bomber and fighter aircraft to fire 21 airstrikes that destroyed two ISIS staging locations, a building, a truck and two vehicles and damaged other ISIS property. Another U.S. strike near the Syrian city of Dayr az Zawr struck a modular oil refinery and initial indications are that this strike was successful. The strikes are meant to prevent the extremist Muslim group from resupplying and massing combat power on the Kurdish-held portions of Kobani, Central Command said in a release. All coalition aircraft used in missions against ISIS departed the space safely, the military said, and analysis of the strikes suggests that they slowed ISIS' advance. But Central Command warned that "the security situation on the ground there remains fluid" with ISIS attempting to gain territory and beat back the Kurdish military, which is putting up a fierce fight. Opinion: Why we must talk to the bad guys -- even ISIS Turkey In or Out? The fight for Kobani brings ISIS right to the border with Turkey, but Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS remain unclear. After U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use an air base and territory for training, Turkish officials said Monday that they had not decided whether to allow use of the Incirlik airbase. On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Turkey is still committed. "I mean, Turkey has agreed to host and train and equip people. It certainly has allowed the use of certain facilities, and we don't need to get into the specifics except to say that I don't believe there is any discrepancy with respect to what they will or won't do." "Kobani is caught in between the United States and Turkey. It's a pawn right now," retired Col. Derek Harvey, the former special adviser to Army Gen. David Petraeus, told CNN's Hala Gorani. Turkey is still focused on removing Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has been fighting it's own battle with Kurdish separatists inside Turkey, Harvey said. Turkey even launched strikes against Kurdish positions within Turkey in recent days, according to its military. Kobani is an example of the fissures that exist within the coalition about the overall strategic goal, Harvey said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Arwa Damon contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <text>(CNN) -- The latest "Worldwide Caution" issued by the U.S. State Department last week made for grim reading, telling of "an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against U.S., Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia." Much of the bulletin dwelled on the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But among a laundry list of dangerous places was this sentence: "Terrorist organizations continue to be active in Yemen, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)." It was a brief, generic commentary on the group still regarded by many analysts as al Qaeda's most effective affiliate, and which is now exploiting a surge in political turmoil in Yemen. As a reminder of how dangerous AQAP is, the State Department on Tuesday published an unusual "wanted" list "offering rewards totaling up to $45 million for information leading to the locations of eight key leaders" of the group. The U.S. has invested heavily in Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was elected in 2012 and pledged to reverse gains that AQAP had made in the south and east of the country. Hadi reorganized Yemen's military, and for a while -- with considerable US assistance -- it put AQAP on the defensive. But on September 21, the country's always combustible political landscape exploded when Houthi rebels seized government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and its airport. The Houthi are Shia Muslims who make up an estimated 30% of the population but have long felt marginalized by the Sunni majority in Yemen. They are now demanding greater political influence. Blast kills 47 at Houthi protest in Yemen Sunni-Shiite divide That is a red rag to radical Sunnis, including supporters or members of AQAP, who regard the Houthi as apostates to be driven from Muslim lands or killed. They claim Iran is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Monday's capture by Houthi militia of much of the coastal city of Hodeida -- Yemen's second-largest port -- will only heighten that fear. Even Hadi has alleged that the Houthis are being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing apprehension. On Monday, Hadi appointed a new Prime Minister, Khaled Bahah, who is currently Yemen's envoy at the United Nations. Some Houthi leaders spoke positively of Bahah's appointment, but unless Houthi militia are reined in, Yemen could quickly become another theater in the Sunni/Shia confrontation gripping much of the Middle East. Exploiting the conflict AQAP is doing as much as it can to stoke a sectarian war. Last week, it launched a devastating suicide bombing against a Houthi rally in Sanaa, which killed nearly 50 people. It also released a video showing its fighters purportedly removing 14 Houthi men from a bus and executing them. At the same time, AQAP has stepped up attacks against the army and police; a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in remote Hadramaut province last week killed 20 soldiers. In recent weeks, the group has released a series of appeals to Sunnis in Yemen to support its campaign against the Houthis, casting itself as the only group capable of preventing what it claims is a plot by Iran to take over the country. Its videos and statements refer to the "Yemeni turned Houthi army." "Do not leave a checkpoint for (the Houthis) that you do not strike, nor a headquarters that you do not bomb, nor a troop carrier that you do not explode," said one of AQAP's leaders, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, in a video released on September 30, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group. Hardline Sunnis in Yemen have staged anti-Houthi demonstrations in recent weeks. And even some in government may now see AQAP as a useful counterweight to the Houthis. The worst-case scenario: a repeat of 2011, when roiling protests in the capital and infighting between different army units allowed AQAP to seize control of several towns in southern Yemen -- towns they held for months. Now, there is the additional destabilizing factor of a growing secessionist movement in the south. Once again, Yemen seems close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly. AQAP defections The main threat to AQAP may be from within, as some jihadists opt for the even more radical option of ISIS. There is now a group called The Islamic State Supporters in the Arabian Peninsula, which has promised attacks against Houthis. According to Flashpoint Partners Intelligence, which monitors jihadist communications, one former AQAP commander, Ma'moun Hatem, has already pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Assuming AQAP can avoid defections, its ability to plan terror attacks beyond the Middle East remains far greater than that of ISIS. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically within an al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. AQAP chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has three times plotted to bring down U.S.-bound aircraft, coming closest to success on Christmas Day in 2009 when a Nigerian recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above Detroit. Earlier this year, AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, who is also al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's deputy, told a large gathering of fighters that attacking the United States was a central priority, a message repeated by al-Ansi last month. "Each front must strike America and its interests everywhere. We have recognized the main enemy, America, for decades," al-Ansi said. While debate rages in Washington and Europe about the intentions of ISIS and al-Nusra in exporting terror to the West, the most lethal of al Qaeda's affiliates is exploiting and stoking Yemen's latest crisis.

            <title>Can U.S. uphold its end of an Iran nuclear deal? - CNN.com</title>

            <highlights>White House's ability to provide Iran with sanctions relief is unclear, writes Tyler Cullis Cullis: A poll suggests Iranians do not believe U.S. is willing to lift sanctions With ISIS conflict, Obama administration cannot afford hostilities with Iran, he says White House involvement needs to accelerate, he writes</highlights>
            <text>Editor's note: Tyler Cullis is a Legal Fellow &amp; Policy Associate at the National Iranian American Council. He is a graduate of the Boston University School of Law. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- With Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry set to meet in Vienna and the November 24 deadline to the P5+1 and Iran nuclear talks in sight, the White House's ability to provide Iran with significant sanctions relief early in a nuclear deal remains unclear. At the same time, any perceived failure by the U.S. to deliver could complicate, if not poison, what will already be a tenuous post-deal period. U.S. negotiators have not helped their cause. During the latest round of talks in New York, the U.S.'s lead negotiator, Wendy Sherman, promised that "as soon as we [the U.S.] suspend our major sanctions -- which will happen very early in the agreement -- the world will flood into Iran." Her comment was echoed by that of Western diplomats, who likewise urged the Iranians "not [to] underestimate the huge economic relief for their people" in case of a nuclear deal. READ: Opinion: U.S. hard-liners missing point on Iran Holding out the carrot to Iran is a sensible negotiating strategy, but only insofar as the U.S. and its European partners can deliver on it. Few, however, believe that to be the case. Companies that would otherwise jump at the opportunity to capture Iran's enormous market are being advised to take a wait-and-see approach in the case of a nuclear deal. At the same time, Iran's population -- according to recent polling -- remains in a state of disbelief as to the U.S.'s willingness to lift the sanctions and turn the page in its relationship with Tehran. This should be a major source of concern. It'd be the ultimate tragedy for the White House, which has spent as much political capital as it has on the nuclear negotiations, to have defeat snatched from the jaws of victory thanks to the lingering effects of its sanctions. With a region in turmoil as ISIS, which calls itself the "Islamic State," continues its rampage through Iraq and the Levant, the Obama administration cannot afford the outbreak of hostilities with Iran. That's why President Obama must take steps to instill confidence in all parties that the U.S. can uphold its end of any nuclear bargain. What can the White House do? First, control the process. What the White House needs to do is take control of the sanctions file, create a plan of action for sanctions relief, and oversee the various federal agencies involved with sanctions enforcement. Some of that has occurred during the interim period of negotiations -- as the White House was not keen on any surprises that would frustrate the Iranians and the nuclear talks in the process -- but White House involvement needs to accelerate if sanctions relief is to take place in a clear and coordinated fashion. Why is this so important? Because European, Asian, and even potentially U.S. firms will be looking at the roll-out of sanctions relief to gauge the speed and confidence with which they (re-)enter Iran. Companies' legal advisers will be paying close attention to whether there is uniformity in the way federal agencies interpret the relevant rules and regulations, including what are expected to be broadened licensing schemes for more expanded trade with and investment in Iran. Uniformity of this kind can only come about under the explicit direction of the White House. Second, signal a shift. While a nuclear deal promises to bring to a close the most tense chapter in U.S.-Iran relations, the post-deal landscape could see the two parties hedging their bets, as commitments are weighed and obligations deferred. Outside observers will view all of this with skepticism, and caution will give way to stasis as the risk of a nuclear deal falling apart dissuades foreign companies from starting up business in or with Iran. That is why the White House must signal a shift in their approach to Iran. That means not just relieving sanctions on a schedule agreed to in the negotiations, but also taking additional measures that persuade firms that there is a sea-change underfoot in the way the West deals with Iran. For starters, the White House should continue a dialogue that has been opened with the Iranians for the first time in three-plus decades. It is no secret that the regional landscape has turned decisively in favor of U.S.-Iran cooperation -- ISIS is a mutual antagonist. Continued negotiations on the range of outstanding issues could signal a change of pace between the two long-time adversaries. The White House could also take discrete measures that instill confidence in firms interested in doing business with Iran. This includes setting up a direct financial channel to select Iranian financial institutions for the processing of licensed transactions. Such a channel could be run from the Federal Reserve, which maintains correspondent relations with banks all over the world. This would ensure that OFAC-licensed activities are able to be undertaken by U.S. persons and would signal to U.S. and foreign financial institutions alike that dealings with Iran are not as risk-prone as in the prior period. Third, reach out and advise. Fair or not, there is a lot of fear out there. Most firms avoid Iran -- even when engagement is permitted -- out of terrified respect for U.S. sanctions enforcers. That means there will need to be a lot of hand-holding to guide U.S. and foreign firms through the thicket of rules and regulations providing Iran sanctions relief. Most companies will need official assurance not once, not twice, but again and again, before undertaking transactions with or activities in Iran. The White House should be prepared to do the requisite outreach and ensure that both the Treasury and State Department are well-staffed to advise firms on the scope of permissible activities. In spite of the wrong-headed advice of its closest allies, the Obama administration has courageously pursued the diplomatic path with Iran. That political courage cannot have been in vain. If, as a senior Obama administration official said this week, "the next two years will be transformative in...[the U.S.-]Iran relations...," then the White House needs to first ensure that it upholds the U.S.'s end of a nuclear bargain. That means not just being prepared to offer Iran sanctions relief, but making sure that the relief sticks and its benefits inure to Iran and its people. There is no better way, after all, to avoid the outcome a nuclear Iran. READ: Opinion: Nuclear deal or no deal, don't expect Iran changes  Loading weather data ...</text>

            <highlights>NEW: Suspected gunman had worked at the same company as the victims NEW: He was recently dismissed "due to drug related issues," embassy says The shooting happened in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh No information on a motive has been immediately released</highlights>
            <text>(CNN) -- One American defense contract worker was killed and another was lightly injured in a shooting at a gas station in Saudi Arabia's capital on Tuesday, a U.S. State Department official said. The two were at a gas station in Riyadh when a gunman opened fire on their car, the country's official news agency reported, citing police in the city. The Saudi Embassy in the United States identified the suspected gunman as Abdulaziz Fahad Abdulaziz Alrashid, 24, a dual Saudi-American citizen who had worked at the same U.S. defense contractor as the victims. He was recently dismissed from the job "due to drug related issues," the Embassy said. Alrashid was reportedly taken into custody following a shootout with security forces, which left him injured. Neither the Americans' names nor information about a possible motive was immediately released. The injured American was taken to a hospital, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The Americans worked for Vinnell Arabia, a U.S. defense contractor supporting the Saudi Arabia National Guard, and were about a half-mile from a Vinnell base when the shooting happened, the State Department official said. Vinnell Arabia, partly owned by U.S.-based Northup Grumman Corp., has helped to train Saudi national guard troops since 1975. It says it has more than 1,250 employees, some of whom are former U.S. troops. More than half of the employees are Saudis, the company says on its website. CNN's Schams Elwazer contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>

            <text>Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and Professor of Practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." David Sterman is a research associate at New America. (CNN) -- Over the past two years, 12 Americans have been charged with supporting militant groups fighting in Syria or have died while fighting with such groups. Who are they? Of the dozen Americans drawn to fight with ISIS or the al Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, a profile does appear to be emerging: They are young, typically high school graduates and college students, who are self-recruited online by what they view as exciting video propaganda pouring out of ISIS and Nusra, and they seek to reach the Syrian battlefields by traveling via Turkey. The dozen Americans are a rainbow of ethnicities; of South Asian, East Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern and African-American descent, according to a survey by New America. For example, Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, a 24-year-old man of Vietnamese descent from California, pleaded guilty last year to attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization. In the plea agreement, he admitted that he had fought in Syria. None of the dozen appears to be of Syrian descent. This is in contrast to the some 30 Americans who were drawn to fight in Somalia from 2007 onward alongside the al Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab group. They were largely of Somali descent and were overwhelmingly from Minnesota, where there is a large Somali-American population. The 12 American militants drawn to the Syrian conflict come from a wide range of states: California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and Texas. They are also generally young with an average age of 24. Three teenagers are among those charged: -- Shannon Conley, a 19-year old California woman pleaded guilty last month to attempting to join ISIS. -- Mohammed Hamza Khan, a 19-year-old Illinois man arrested this month, allegedly sought to join ISIS. He is awaiting trial. -- Abdella Tounisi from Chicago was 18 when he was charged last year with seeking to support Nusra in Syria. He is on trial. The Americans seeking to fight in Syria are not a particularly educated group. For the nine of the 12 individuals for whom educational attainment is known, none graduated from college. Perhaps critically, all but two of the 12 were active on jihadi social media. ISIS in particular has made a determined effort to recruit Western fighters over social media, for example releasing a 55-minute English language propaganda and recruitment video on Twitter last month. The heavy social media use of individuals traveling to Syria is something of a boon for American security services. The social media use of Douglas McCain, a 33-year-old man from Minnesota, who died fighting with ISIS in August, reportedly landed him on a terrorist watch list and helped the United States track him. Once individuals are radicalized and are convinced to join ISIS or Nusra, they often decide to travel to Syria through Turkey. -- Moner Abu Salha, a 22-year-old from Florida, explained how he traveled to Turkey and met up with jihadist facilitators there in a propaganda video that was released in August after he died conducting a suicide bombing in Syria. -- Douglas McCain also traveled through Turkey earlier this year. -- Adam Dandach, a 20-year-old from Orange County, California, was arrested in July for passport fraud en route to Turkey allegedly to join ISIS. He is on trial. -- Mohammed Hamza Khan purchased tickets to travel to Turkey via Austria according to the complaint filed in his case. The importance of the Turkish route into Syria likely provides the key to reduce the number of Americans traveling to fight in Syria. For example, look at the case of Donald Morgan, a 44-year-old from North Carolina, who sought to travel to fight in Syria but has not been charged with a terrorism-related crime. He was turned back at Istanbul Airport by Turkish authorities this summer. There are reports that Turkey may be stepping up its efforts to close the routes that allow foreigners to reach the Syrian conflict and join jihadist groups. We can only hope that is the case. U.S. law enforcement has also made a determined effort to track Americans engaged in the Syrian conflict. Seven of the 12 individuals charged in the past two years were monitored closely by an FBI informant. Even in the case of Moner Abu Salha, who returned from training in Syria to the States in May 2013, a tip to the FBI from a friend he tried to recruit when he was back in the States placed him on the FBI's radar. Still there are limits to that tracking. FBI Director James Comey was asked by the CBS show "60 Minutes" earlier this month whether he knew the identity of the dozen or so Americans believed to be fighting in Syria. Comey said, "I think of that, dozen or so, I do. I hesitate only because I don't know what I don't know." Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            <title>ISIS states its justification for enslavement of women - CNN.com</title>

            <text>(CNN) -- In a new publication, ISIS justifies its kidnapping of women as sex slaves citing Islamic theology, an interpretation that is rejected by the Muslim world at large as a perversion of Islam. "One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah, or Islamic law," the group says in an online magazine published Sunday. The title of the article sums up the ISIS point of view: "The revival (of) slavery before the Hour," referring to Judgment Day. The fourth edition of the group's English-language digital magazine called "Dabiq" said that female members of the Yazidi sect, an ethnically Kurdish minority living mostly in Iraq, may legitimately be captured and forcibly made concubines or sexual slaves. The rationalization for a return to slavery -- repudiated around the world -- coincided with the release of a Human Rights Watch report on crimes committed by ISIS against the Yazidis in Iraq based on interviews with 76 displaced people in Dohuk. "The Islamic State's litany of horrific crimes against the Yazidis in Iraq only keeps growing," said Fred Abrahams, special adviser at Human Rights Watch. "We heard shocking stories of forced religious conversions, forced marriage, and even sexual assault and slavery -- and some of the victims were children." A 17-year-old kidnapped girl named Adlee recounts how a large bearded man forced her into a home in Falluja, where she was beaten and endured violent sexual advances before escaping two days later, the Human Rights Watch report reads. ISIS forced tens of thousands of Yazidis to flee their homes in August when the extremists stormed many of the community's towns and cities in Iraqi Kurdistan. Displaced families and monitoring groups reported jihadists kidnapped hundreds of Yazidi women and girls, and many were sold or given away to militants as "spoils of war." The terror group's 56-page propaganda publication also boasts of a "massacre against (Kurdish) PKK soldiers" alongside graphic images of slain men dressed in fatigues. On the next page, ISIS glorifies its "Services for Muslims" with photographs of a care home for the elderly and a cancer treatment center for children. The issue, titled "The Failed Crusade," includes an alleged copy of slain American journalist Steven Sotloff's last letter to his mother and says the victim's Jewish identity warranted his beheading by ISIS. Another ISIS captive, British journalist John Cantlie, allegedly pens the last section of the magazine, saying he expects to be killed soon, and "unless something changes very quickly and very radically, I await my turn."

            <text>(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made an urgent plea as a donor conference to rebuild Gaza kicked off Sunday morning in Cairo. "The cycle of building and destroying must end," Ban said in his opening remarks. "Donors may be fatigued, but the people of Gaza are bruised and bloody. Enough is enough." He said he hoped this would be the last Gaza reconstruction conference. "It is time to chart a course to a just and final peace between Israelis and Palestinians -- one that addresses all the outstanding issues," he said. The U.N. chief plans to visit Gaza on Tuesday to listen directly to its people and survey the situation. He will also visit Israel. Rebuilding Gaza after this year's conflict with Israel will cost $4 billion, says the Palestinian Authority, which is presenting a reconstruction plan Sunday. The governments of Egypt and Norway are hosting the Cairo conference to help raise the funds needed, according to Egypt's Foreign Affairs Ministry. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa will be joined by some of the world's most powerful diplomats, including the foreign ministers of Japan, France and Italy. They will speak about the challenges of rebuilding and how to approach the international response. Multiple global aid organizations are also participating. Officials announce aid to Gaza U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced an additional $212 million in aid to rebuild Gaza, shortly after he arrived in Cairo early Sunday. The money doubles the amount already pledged, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $414 million. Kerry said that raising funds should not be the only goal of the conference. "I say clearly and with deep conviction here today, the United States remains fully and totally committed to returning to negotiations not just for the sake of it, but because the goal of this conference and the future of the region demand it," he said. He called for long-term investments in the Palestinian economy to create a vibrant private sector. Qatar announced a $1 billion dollar donation Sunday. "Well, I think it won't simply be Qatar pledging money; all the other Arab countries will pledge money as well," former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Middle East Quartet representative, told CNN's Becky Anderson. He said the money would go through the right channels. "If the Palestinian Authority as envisaged are in charge of that process of reconstruction, this money will go through them, will go through a proper treasury account properly administered," Blair said. "So we are taking a lot of painstaking efforts to make sure the money goes for the purpose for which it was intended and goes to benefit the people in Gaza." The Quartet is an informal diplomatic group made up of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia. It aims to promote Middle East peace and Palestinian development. Israeli response Israel was not invited to the conference, but that does not mean that it wants to prevent the reconstruction of Gaza, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in an interview with Israel Radio on Sunday Lieberman said that it was important that funds raised in Cairo not be used to produce weapons or build tunnels in Gaza. He added that it was up to Palestinians to prevent another operation in Gaza. "We are not looking for adventures, but if the rocket is renewed, Israel has a right to defend itself," he said. Operation Protective Edge Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in July, saying the military operation was aimed at stopping Hamas rocket attacks and destroying a network of tunnels that extended under the border with Israel. More than 2,130 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in Gaza during the 50 days of fighting that followed. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. Sixty-eight people were killed on the Israeli side, two of whom were civilians. Many homes, schools and other buildings in Gaza were destroyed or damaged before a ceasefire was reached in late August. The United Nations estimates that 60,000 Gazans were still living in shelters in late September. CNN's Michael Schwartz in Jerusalem contributed to this report. Loading weather data ...</text>
